2			gun	violence	ethic	sex	murder			 so , do any xxxx , i mean police officers read this stuff ? . hey , what the hell do you mean by that ? you suck . i have a god given right to express opinions , carry a gun and to not wear a helmet , goddamn it . everything you stand for is stupid .  i would give it an 0 . 5 on a scale of 10 . while not mentioning hitler or koresh weighs in your favor , you also neglected to mention 105 mph , tennis balls , little girls and countersteering . another thing to consider is , that like mexican food , a lot of folks mistake heat for quality . subtle references to various personal qualities habits ancestry possesions generally earn more points than four letter words or the caps lock key . and introducing a new polysyllabic word strabismic , for example is likely to insure that some small part of your flame will become immortal .  blaine gardner evans & sutherland  aw , c mon . the serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points , not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say . the non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish . i personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames . the first does trade quality , in the sense you mention , for heat . this has a certain surprise value and if done correctly , which i contend was done above , is reasonably entertaining . while it is true that the flame i posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity , friends , dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short . the weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far , at which point it becomes trite and boring . witness the infante thread recently . the other type of flame , which you seem to be glorifying above , has a few weaknesses as well . in the first place , it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme , particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other . in the second , discussing someone's personal qualities , habits , and so forth can quickly become libelous . or is that slanderous ? i can never remember the difference . this leads to a proliferation of lawyers , which is widely regarded as a bad thing . finally , introducing polysyllabic words is problematic . i can not haul my big dic . around on my bike , and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning , especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general . in summary , blaine , your score for that flame is incorrect . while it may be the wunder flame , the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses , and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable . you also probably couldn not outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and i will bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning . the same goes for anyone who looks like you , too .  tommy mcguire . i will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information , identifying it as personal and as independent of ibm .

2			baseball	sport	football			 new uniforms as far as i know , toronto , pittsburgh , and new york nl change their uniforms every year . every other year e.g . new york , it will say mets in cursive , new york in cursive , or new york in all caps . minor changes , but they do change them often . last year , i think they had new york in all caps . did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year ? what about pittsburgh ? it depends on which uniforms you are talking about . for the last couple of years i believe toronto and pittsburgh has used the same uniforms , or at least very similar . the home jerseys had the team nick name blue jays or pirates , but the road jerseys had the name of the city toronto or pittsburgh . i believe this is the way most teams design their uniforms. chris

5			rape	homosexual	homosexuality	sex	sexuality			 homosexuality recently an email to me mentioned technically , the messengers aren not even human so it can not be a case of homosexuality even of rape . the jude reference to sodom is also meaningful only in the context of the sodomites lust for the other flesh of angels . again , application to homosexual behavior in general , or to the position of gay christians is largeely specious .  are angels flesh ? no. i feel that this is saying that it was because of their lust after other men , who are flesh or of this world . what are other opinons on this ? i haven not heard much about this verse at all . bo reike in the anchor bible volume on james , peter , and jude points out that all the examples given in this section of jude are distinguishing the elect from apostates , not just the wicked in general . hence , those who were delivered from egypt , but did not follow moses and , by extension , god ; the apostate angels ; and sodom and gomorrah . quoting reike fornication may here , as often in the new testament , refer to idolatry , while flesh as in i pet 1 24 denotes human society and its violent attempts at self exaltation . sodom and gommorrah represent the leaders of apostasy , and the surrounding cities correspond to their followers . p . 199 there is no inherent reason to read this verse 7 as literally referring to actual sexual lust for alien flesh . nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality , outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of sodom is the sin of homosexuality . the only place that the sin of sodom is specified , and not merely inferred , is in ezekiel 16 49 this was the guilt of your sister sodom she and her daughters had pride , excess of food , and prosperous ease , bit did not aid the poor and needy . they were haughty , and did abominable things before me ; therefore i removed them when i saw it . for the same reason overliteralizing the text your correspondent's suggestion that the reason the passage doesn not deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly . there are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se .
3			electronics	radar	detectors	radiation	satellite	astronomy			 gamma ray bursters . positional stuff . actually , my advisor , another classmate of mine , and me were talking the other day about putting just one detector on one of the pluto satellites . then we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200 pounds of eq . well , a batse detector needs lead shielding to protect it , and 1 alone weighs about 200 pounds itself . we decided against it . jeremy are you talking about a single batse component , or the whole thing ? you could propose a batse probe ; launch two or three with ion drive on various planetary trajectories . your resolution increaces the more they are spaced apart . you could probably cheaply eject them from the solar system with enough flybys and patience . things would start out slow , then slowly get better and better resolution .  phil fraering seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff . like how the ancient mayans had televison . repo man
5			homosexual	lgbt	homosexuality	gay	theology	sexuality			 homosexuality issues in christianity bible verses ag . used ag . homosexuality deleted anyone who thinks being gay and christianity are not compatible should check out dignity , integrity , more light presbyterian churches , affirmation , mcc churches , etc. meet some gay christians , find out who they are , pray with them , discuss scripture with them , and only then form your opinion . also check out the episcopal church although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women , there certainly is a fairly large percentage in my experience who are . i am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous homosexual relationship . this in no way diminishes his ability to minister in fact he has a very significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his community , as well as a very significant aids ministry . this may sound argumentative , but do the pro homosexual crowd give the same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships ? if we do a little substitution above , we get although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous men and women , there certainly is a fairly larget percentage in my experience who are . i am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship . this in no way diminishes his ability to minister in fact he has a very significant ministry with the incest association of his community . do the same standards apply ? if not , why not ? and while we are in the ballpark , what about bestiality ? i can not recall offhand if there are any direct statements in the bible regarding sex with animals ; does that activity have more or less a sanction ? please avoid responses such as you are taking this to extremes . i would guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant bible community views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at large views incest   scott cokely 714 833 4760 they came for the davidians , but i did not speak up because i was not a davidian . then they came for me . opinions expressed are mine and do not represent those of rockwell .  obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by anything from murder to sleeping late . that doesn not mean that the same people would accept those substitutions . the question is whether the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent christ's relationship to humanity . this is at least partly an empirical question . in some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because over time they always seem to lead to trouble . i think that's the case with slavery . one can argue that in theory , if you follow paul's practice , over a period of time , most people came to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it . the message you were responding to was asking you to look at the results from christian communities that endorse homosexuality . note christian homosexuals , not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda . you may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation , but i would argue that it's at least relevant . you can not answer the request by asking why you shouldn not look at the incest association , because in fact there is no such association . if there were , it might be reasonable for you to look at it too . of course that doesn not mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way . part of why there aren not groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results . clh

3			gun	violence	war	killing	murder			 overreacting was re once tapped , your code is no good any more in this giant bally ho over this clipper chip i noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the email and posts i have tossing back and forth .  somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this .  the reason is very simple how many people do you want to die in a riot ? in a new civil war ?  everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it , and i m worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper .  can people work within the system before trying to break it ? a circut court judge in illinois once said when dealing with a government that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its citizenry , one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means to parry this attack on personal privacy . unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar detectors . the point remains . more and more i see the government slowly washing away privacy . even unwittingly . do you think i will ever live in a soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth ? do you think i will live in a soceity that insists i register my crypto keys so they can keep track of what i m saying ? even if there is no evidence of my guilt ? do you think i will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle in the affairs of its citizenry without recourse of any kind ? i m tired of it . there is imho no compromise with an administration that seeks to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy . more than the proposals themselves , i read the language of the press releases , the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to the public , and i am sickened . i am revolted . i am repulsed . 90 , perhaps even 95 of this country could care less about the clipper chip , the wiretap bill , the smart card , because they are so entrapped in the rhetoric of the clinton administration . this saddens and frightens me . i am a conserveative believe it or not . a law and order conserveative . but the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me , mostly because i know you cant go far wrong underestimating the intelligence of the american people . tell them it's going to keep them safe from drug dealers and terrorists , and they will let you put cameras in their home . even in the wake of waco , you find those who support the increasingly totalatarian moves . somebody once said something like armed violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack . it is not meant to be used in agression . this is the difference between self defence and murder . to be quite honest , the way things are going , i would call it self defense . let's try to avoid killing things , eh ? there's enough blood shed in the world , without adding a couple of riots , civil wars , etc.  i m probably overreacting . but what i have read scared me a lot . i don not want my children growing up in a war zone . and i dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera 24 hours a day .  jerry han crc doc div . of behavioural research these are my opinions , and my opinions only . a proud and frozen member of the mighty warriors band memories of those i have left behind , still ringing in my ears . genesis uni  public keys by finger and or request public key archives sovereignty is the sign of a brutal past fight clinton's wiretap chip ! df610670f2467b99 97de2b5c3749148c crypto is not a crime ! ask me how !

3			diabetes	infection	science	health	cancer	ethic	prevention			 getting aids from acupuncture needles someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture needles . unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aids . it is unlikely not impossible they will get aids from acupuncture needles . generally , even if accidently inoculated , the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion . most acupuncturists use disposable needles . use once and throw away . they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route . so it's good business to advertise disposable needlesused here . these needles tend to be of a lower quality however , being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion . they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles . if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint , that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments . the risk here for hepatitis , hiv , etc. transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient . but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk . better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags . and hematomas . so i use them . acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses . but they are all solid when compared to their injection style cousins . in china , herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine . this means . thinkingtiny . that a samll amount of tissue , the diameter of the needle bore , will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical shot . when the skin is puntured . on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted , the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that haven not been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion , tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior . of course in tcm . the body's exterior is protected by the wei protective qi . so infection is unlikely . or in other words . there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site . while i m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion , i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist . not to know if it would be harmful . but to know if it would be helpful . john badanes , dc , ca

5			witchcraft	religion	translation	word	controversy	god			 satanic tounges peter white relates a story about a person who gives a message in tongues which consists entirely of the words pu ka . he was asked to refrain from doing that . well , brother puka controlled himself for a while , but a few weeks later , the church had invited a missionary in to speak . at the time of the meeting where tongues and interpretation were appropriate , who should arise to speak but brother puka . and off he went as before , all the words were puka . the pastor was about to apologize for this embarrassment when the missionary arose to speak saying that he was sorry that he did not have the interpretation but that he could give the translation . in a tribe where he had worked , they only had one word in the language , puka . meaning was derived from the inflection and other voice qualities . brother puka had given a perfectly inflected and reasonable message . nice story but it sets off my urban legend or is it charismatic legend ? alarms. can the linguists on the net identify the language from the description ? or can they even attest that such a language exists . it seems to be odd enough at least by the standards of european languages that if it exists , it should be reasonably well known to linguists as an extreme case of something or other . or have i just overreacted to your basic shaggy dog story ? will  william taber any opinions expressed data general corporation are mine alone and may westboro , mass . 01580 change without notice .  when all your dreams are laid to rest , you can get what's second best , but it's hard to get enough . david wilcox

3			science	cancer	toxicity	smoking			 is msg sensitivity superstition ?  for cites on msg , look up almost anything by john w . olney , a toxicologist who has studied the effects of msg on the brain and on development . it is undisputed in the literature that msg is an excitotoxic food additive , and that its major constituent , glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain humans included . too much in the diet , and the system gets thrown off . glutamate and aspartate , also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , and are freely available in many foods , but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food . by eating lots of junk food , packaged soups , and diet soft drinks , it is possible to jack your blood levels so high , that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous real physi9logical effects . read olney's review paper in prog . brain res , 1988 , and check his sources . they are impecable . there is no dispute .  dianne murray  in order to excitotoxin effects of msg , msg that in blood must go through blood brain barrier that i am not sure msg can go through or not . elevated levels of glu and asp in the blood are able to bypass the blood brain barrier through the circumventricular organs or cvo , in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis pituitary gland areas . the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus , and the median eminence regions are particularly effected . cvo areas are not subject to the blood brain barrier . these areas control the release of gonadotropin , which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development , especially sexual development . changes in adult rats , which are less sensitive to glu than humans , have been observed after ingesting glu , on a chronic basis , cycles of several steroids are disrupted . blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced , and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened . hope this helps . dianne murray

3			genetics	biotechnology	bacteria	science	cancer	biology	dna			 robert's biological alchemy robert , i m so glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion . i have been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci . med . i didn not know how to respond since i had not seen one of your posts just like i haven not read the yeast connection . let me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile i believe that one has actually left the country . scientific fraud is rare . i m still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation . your sources do not seem to be research articles . they are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combining and life extension texts . robert , i try to keep an open mind . but some things i just can not buy one is taking sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body . your experiment , if conducted by readers of this news group , would prove that you are right more ash after seed sprouting than before . unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above 600 degrees i believe , you will get organic residue in the ash . even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue . i remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i couldn not find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i m really guessing at 600 degrees f , it may actually be much higher . the point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash . they also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct . chemical reactions abound in our body , in our atmosphere , in our water and in our soil . are these fusion reactions ? yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen , nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics . do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon ? not in my book robert . silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet . i have seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life form . i like reading science fiction , as many people do . but i know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most cases to separate the fiction from the fact . silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans . we have several grams of the stuff in our body . what's it doing there ? only the lord knows right now . but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why , as you state , it helps bone healing and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium . almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin . there have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the higher the silicon content in elastin , the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans . for bone fracture healing , the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts . a high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation . this first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going . electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap or gaps between the ends of the broken bone . a vitamin c deficiency by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing . zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing . and so is silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium . for you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick . but robert , i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press and yes even some scientific papers . is the explanation reasonable ? without a very good science knowledge base , you and most readers of this news group are flying blind you have to take it on faith because you don not know any better . if the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base , i m inclined to consider it this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion . if the idea like a candida bloom seems to make sense to me , i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that i m going to give isn not going to really mess somebody up . if this makes us kindred souls robert , then i guess i will have to live with that label . for the physicians who have decided to read my response to robert's interesting post , i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on u.s. tv . i can not remember the network or his name like many nights , i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv in our den where i have my computer setup . this neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional treatments his own words . he says that he has a 70 success rate . the one case that i heard him discussing would normally use radiation conventional treatment . he was going to go in and cut . you guys complain about the cost of the anti fungals . what do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys ? i m going to ask you guys one more time , why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer like jon and the chronic gi sufferer like elaine and tries to help them using unconventional treatments ? treatments which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon uses ? is it because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are ? how about quality of life guys ? may the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut if it does , you may feel differently about the issue . marty b .

3			genetics	biotechnology	bacteria	science	health	cancer	dr	antibiotic	biology			 candida yeast bloom , fact or fiction to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics ? gorden rubenfeld , through email , has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body . i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice . nor is it mine . what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections . marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists . anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this . at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group . i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora . however , it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics . i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients . whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i will leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials . one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c . difficile colitis not a fungal infection . there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora . don not try this at home . not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams. since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area , gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use . except that it isn not . at least symptomatically apparent disease . medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way . there has always been the use of conventional wisdom . a very good example is kidney stones . conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention , was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming . clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed . through the recent new england j of medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong , increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake . seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial , like au dismukes w e . wade j s . lee j y . dockery b k . hain j d . ti a randomized , double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med . 1990 dec 20 . 323 25 . p 1717 23 . psychological tests . results . the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than 0 . 001 , but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo . conclusions . in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome , nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo . consequently , the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted . does this trial address every issue raised here , no. jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn not use sporanox despite crook's recommendation for nystatin . maybe they didn not avoid those carbohydrates . the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy . if it makes sense for livestock , why doesn not it make sense for humans david ? we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous . if this were a standard part of medical practice , as gordon r . says it is , then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline . marty , you have also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms. there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials . are we talking about real candida infections , the whole yeast connection hypothesis , the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans , or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc . we can not seem to focus in on a disease , a therapy , or a hypothesis under discussion .  i m lost !

5			politics	war	killing	torture	murder			 death penalty gulf war long i don not regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people . but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary , and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions . i m afraid i m going to have to kill you . don not worry , though ; as a loving christian , i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you , although i won not regret the actual killing . if we hadn not intervened , allowing hussein to keep kuwait , then it would have been appeasement .  right . but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action ? or are you just setting up a strawman ?  i m not setting up a strawman at all . if you want to argue against the war , then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait . false dichotomy . diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective . that's because they weren not even attempted . but what about those who didn not support hitler's dreams of conquest ? it's not as if they democratically voted for all his policies . the nsdap got 43 in the elections of 1933 , and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter .  they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much ? you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww2 , when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary ? the world is full of evil , and circumstances are not perfect . many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others . it it regretable , but that's the way it is . and why is it that way ? who set things up to be that way ? this was happening before the gulf war . why didn not we send in the bombers to east timor ? why aren not we sending in the bombers now ?  probably because we are not the saviors of the world . we can not police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another . no , just the ones that have oil . or the ones that look like they might make a success of communism . nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet , east timor , or some other places . i don not see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting them to iraq . tibetan people are rounded up , tortured , and executed . amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china .  why aren not we stopping them ? in fact , why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them ?  tell me how we could stop them and i will support it . i , for one , do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it . i agree that it is deplorable . fine . write to your congressman and to president clinton . china's status as most favoured nation comes up for renewal in june . point out that the us shouldn not be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime . i doubt anything will happen . clinton's keener on trade sanctions against europe . unbelievable comments about the rodney king case deleted the media is not totally monolithic . even though there is a prevailing liberal bias , programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news . there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look . hurrah for rush ! any idea how many kill files you just ended up in ? i , an atheist , am arguing against killing innocent people .  you , a supposed christian , are arguing that it's ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well .  hardly . i didn not say that it's a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately , we don not live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions . if one is going to resist tyranny , then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die . i didn not say it is ok it is unfortunate , but sometimes necessary . the ends justify the means , eh ? you , having criticised moral relativism in the past , are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war .  you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist the same tired old misunderstanding . moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of morality . it doesn not mean you can not judge other people's morals . christ on a bike , how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head ? where's your christian love ? where's your absolute morality ? oh , how quick you are to discard them when it suits you . as ivan stang would say , jesus would puke !  one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action ; even this discourse in this forum . i understand the full ramifications of that , and i am prepared to do so . i don not believe that you can make the same claim . obviously not , as i am an atheist i don not think you would get on with jesus , though ; he was a long haired lunatic peace nik , was he not ? and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn not accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time . but in the gulf war , precision bombing was the norm . so the point was , why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing , when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww2 ? right . unfortunately for you , it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too . i think you are being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy , too . you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door . as i understand it , that is not the case ; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german people . civilians suffer . but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history ! oh , come on . with wars like the falklands fresh in people's minds , that sort of propaganda isn not going to fool anyone . the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . yes , bunk . the us lost 230 , 000 servicemen in ww2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! yes ? and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered ? it's hardly surprising the us didn not lose many men in ww2 , given that you turned up late . mathew

2			basketball	sport	hockey	playoff	football	boston	overtime	baseball			 vlad's playoff picks wales conference , adams division , semifinal boston vs . buffalo the bruins are playing some excellent hockey , and with cam neely back and moog his old self again this should be a cake walk . bruins in 5 . i m hoping for a fuhr miracle , but i agree that boston will likely win the series . goaltending is about equal , top offensive players are about equal mogilny lafontaine vs . oates juneau , but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw , in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn bruin . and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway . but i think it will go six . quebec vs . montreal this one is very tough to call . montreal certainly has the experience factor , but quebec is more talented imho . it will come down to the goalies . i will go with experience and roy . canadiens in 7 . agreed here . but montreal will be pushed to the limit . is it just me , or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy ? go habs ! final boston vs . montreal will bruin domination continue in this rivalry ? yes . moog has consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after 1986 . other stuff bruins in five . i can not predict a montreal victory because i have been watching them play for 6 weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players , especially to play in the garden . last time they beat the b's 5 2 but boston had a clear territorial advantage ; the victory was roy's . at the same time , i can not bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss , so i will just say i will not be putting money on this series . patrick division , semifinal pittsburgh vs . ny islanders what can i say ? the pens are flying high and have the most talent in the league . agreed . ny doesn not have the goaltending to stop the onslaught , independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year . pens in five , which is credit to ny . washington vs . new jersey capitals in 5 . agreed here too , but i think it will go at least six . jersey has a decent team , and washington has done poorly against the division this year . pittsburgh vs . washington if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset , but don beaupre just doesn not inspire my hopes . penguins in 6 . i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled . i don not think it will go six either . maybe five . conference final pittsburgh vs . boston a replay of last year . the penguins are just as good as 12 months ago , and the bruins are much improved . but . penguins in 6 . if pittsburgh plays boston , imo they win in likely five , possibly six . they own the bruins . if they play montreal , i think it will go to seven , and once again i won not be putting money on the seventh game . i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season . campbell conference , norris division , semifinal chicago vs . st louis or minnesota blackhawks in 5 . chicago will win , but i think in at least six . chicago is not that good , imo . and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties . detroit vs . toronto the leafs have had an excellent season , but they have been playing playoff hockey all year the habs under burns were the same way and always wilted in the playoffs . red wings in 5 . very true . the leafs have much to be proud of , but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs . toronto might win two or three at mlg though . wings in six , maybe even seven . final chicago vs . detroit this will be a war . fedorov will win it in ot . red wings in 7 . it will be a war . possibly the most intense playoff series of them all . and yes , i think detroit will win . probert will have to come up big though . smythe division semi finals vancouver vs . winnipeg canucks in 7 . our first disagreement . canucks are playing like shit . they don not use their size at all , which may explain why they get hammered 8 1 by a team chasing them calgary . winnipeg in six . calgary vs . los angeles this would have been tough to call , except for three things . 1 the kings don not have a goalie ; 2 gary roberts will be back ; 3 the kings shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson . gretzky is just too weary to carry this group . flames in 5 . this is also tough for me to call , because i haven not seen the smythe enough . i don not think roberts will be well enough to figure in , coffey is a non issue , who cares what carson has done before , and never underestimate gretzky . la in six . final vancouver vs . calgary flames in 6 . if it is these two , calgary will not need six games . but i think it will be la winnipeg anyway , and la in seven , because of home ice . coference final detroit vs . calgary red wings in 7 . wow , must have been tough to go against your team . but let's see , i picked la detroit . detroit will win , probably in six . stanley cup final pittsburgh vs . detroit three in a row and official would ynasty status for the pens ? or can the wings complete a dream season ? well , the wings are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better d men . however , mario and the boys can sure score . look for jagr to shine in the playoffs , though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him . the pens are just too much , especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here . penguins in 5 . if pittsburgh plays detroit , it will go longer than five , and i wouldn not bet against the wings . they are very strong , imo , and nobody knows how strong because they have been underachieving most of the year . if forced to choose , though , i would have to take the penguins . a side note . vlad , last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour . no way . he is a more talented pure goal scorer . but aside from the age difference , there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team . i m not asking for flames , either , btw . i have spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he's a great player . but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge , gilmour does it all . i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on , esp . from flame fans . but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill . he is easily one of the best all round players in the nhl .

4			firearm	gun	canada	violence	weapon	america	murder			 my gun is like my american express car  i m not . i m in canada . we have far fewer shootings like this . we have had , i believe , one mass murder in the last twenty years .  i m not going to say we don not have our gun problems. but we do have the world's largest undefended boarder with one of the most gun happy countries in the world . i think canada illustrates that gun control does have an effect . in fact , it's suprising that there is any difference considering how easy it is to smuggle a gun from the u.s.  yes , it's amazing , isn not it . in fact , it should tell you that gun control is not the reason your crime rate is low , since any idiot can smuggle guns into canada from the us at any time .  i think paul was trying to make the point that any idiot doesn not . there are surely some idiots who do smuggle guns , but paul seems to feel that the exis tence of stricter gun control laws has had a deterrent effect . this seems a strange argument to make considering that canada's violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the u.s. our non gun crime rate is greater than their entire crime rate . it would seem strange to suggest that it , to , were the result of gun control laws . i think if we looked we would find very specific cultural and enforcement reasons why the non gun rate is low as well , and then that reasons could be applied to the with gun rates as easily . given that most criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who purchase them legally , having more restrictions on legal possession does seem to have the effect of reducing gun related crimes . aside from the fact that i find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution , it still doesn not address the question of canada . which is now , by the way , blaming their rising gun crime rate on the u.s. strange that the border used to magically keep the guns out , but now isn not . it certainly makes sense that it would . well , it makes sense to some of us , anyway . the other side of the coin , of course , is that far illegal drugs are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally . i have still not been convinced that guns , a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources stolen either from police , military , or civilian we wouldn not simply see south american sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well , since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there . if you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics , you would realize that our non gun crime rate is also very high , so guns per se are not the issue  directly contradicted by the nejm study that compared crime in seattle and vancouver , b . c . the non gun rates were roughly the same for both cities . the difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun related . and as was not pointed out in the study , but in critiques of it , two seperate articles by james wright and david kopel come to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost entirely minority related . that is , the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities blacks and hispanics primarily while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical . the problem with the nejm study was they compared minority vs . non minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities . that there was an eqaul percentage of nomn whites was about as far as they went . they failed to take into account that the non whites in either city were not living in the same conditions . if the situation was entirely based on availability of guns , then we would expect that the white rates , the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities , would have a far higher rate in seattle . yet the majority in seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded , but slightly lower . violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city  surprise . pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty , drug use , disease , etc. since rates are lower in suburbia , us middle class folks can ignore the problem . the point is , of course , that many of the u.s. inner city problems are not mirrored in canada . as such if there is a condition which is significantly different in canada from the u.s . and violent crime is highly correlated to that area , suggesting that gun control is the source of canada's low rate is highly questionable . as one canadian pointed out on talk . politics . guns , canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates , which have been rising steadily since . apparently they didn not even mirror the u.s.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties . most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already  post hoc ergo propter hoc . those areas implemented gun control because of the high rates . true only to a certain extent . take washington d . c . where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true , but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards . similarly for new york . the question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low . did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime . since it's gone up in those areas , often faster than it was going up before , you can not simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it . yes , gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime . but if the crime is not positively impacted , you can not continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control , since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented , just as happened in canada . similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control . as would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control . and the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in washington d . c . may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there . would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns , and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them ?  david veal univ . of tenn . div . of cont . education info . services group i still remember the way you laughed , the day your pushed me down

1			saving	marketing	computer	business	buying	consumer			 consumer warning midwest micro ohio thinking of buying from midwest micro of ohio ? think very carefully . unless you are absolutely sure you won not have any problems , you may want to trade elsewhere . despite the fact that they answer the phone , hi ! i m whoever and we are having a great day ! they weren not quite so happy when i wanted to return a modem that didn not work as i expected it to . the details i ordered one of their house brand infotel 14 . 4 df internal fax modems. in reality , it was a twincom lightning fax that had a paper sticker over the name . given the poor reports on the net about this modem , i would not have ordered it , had i known this in advance . it arrived on time . the documentation stated that it would work and was preconfigured as com4 , providing that com2 was not in use at the same time . for several reasons , i have a serial card configured for com1 com2 . at the time i installed the modem , nothing was connected to com2 . although the modem appeared to work , during every connection at 9600 or 14 . 4 , it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone . after spending some time on the phone with midwest's tech support , they suggested disabling the com2 port . this appeared to solve the disconnect problem , but was an unacceptable long term solution . i had to have com1 and 2 available , even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem . i called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in voicemail hell , listening to repeated advertisements for midwest micro products . i was then promptly disconnected . apparently it was quiting time and they didn not want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line . i called the next day and asked the customer diservice agent for an rma number . she promptly switched me to a tech support rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn not going to give me an rma number . he suggested i use some nonstandard irq settings , a solution i was not happy with . the modem should work as originally configured . conclusion i m not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system , but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine . since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem , i gave it to a local charitable organization with a description of my problem and ordered a practical peripherals 14 . 4mt from pc connection . for $ 30 more , i have a solid external modem built by a company i know will support their users and sold by a company based on personal experience will treat me right if there is a problem . i should have known better .

2			electronics	weapon	missile	radar			 best radar detector valentine 1 ? originator blf stargazer from article , by troy wecker  earlier i commented on the valentine 1 and replied about the value of the units bogey counter . i didn not really go into why i called this feature a gimmick so here is more explanation . thanks jim for the good comments and opinion . . . . from what i understand the valentine 1 can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front , rear or both . there are only two antennas . if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey . bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source . . . . it sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the valentine 1 . i would like to give some feedback based on real life experince . i keep the valentine 1 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a christmas tree . the only time it does is when i am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are 8 sources coming from many different directions . i have found the valentine 1 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area . i have found the directional indication to be very useful . in one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other . as i passed the first radar trap , the direction indication changed . then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction . with other radar detectors i would have assumed that this was due to a reflection . but with the valentine 1 i knew there was a high probability that there was another trap . and there was ! on other occasions , the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm . for example , as i pass a source , the direction indicator changes . the directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place . when a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks , i can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me i can verify the source . with other detectors , i would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none . i have had the valentine 1 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks . barry   barry frishberg chelmsford uk expert center 508 tn 436 4319 chelmsford , ma

2			phillies	comic	softball	philadelphia	baseball	pitcher			 the 1964 phillies deja vu ? phillies  after reading my local paper today , i found out that the phillies started the 1964 season at 10 2 . i am not as old as 1964 , but i have heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season . they were ahead of the cardinals by 15 games that season in mid august they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division . 15 ! games ahead and lost it . i hope this season is much different . strictly from memory , i think the phillies were something like ten games up with 12 to go , lost 10 in a row , and 11 of last 12 to lose to the cardinals . seems impossible , but thats how i remember it . i also felt at the time that johnny callison of the phillies lost the mvp as a by product of their swoon . jerry ps in 1964 , a single team out of 8 won the pennant ; no divisions .

2			interference	football	scoring	baseball	rule			 rule book trivia 2 rule 7 . 09 k states it is interference by a batter or runner when in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base . he runs outside the three foot line , or inside to the left of the foul line and , in the umpire's judgment , interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base .  the key word in the rule is and . a runner isn not out just for running out of the baseline . he's out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batter runner's head , there's no inter ference . sorry , i still don not buy it . you are certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with the play . but the argument here is over what constitutes interference . you certainly cannot infer from what you have quoted that the batter runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you haven not posted a definition of interference at all . imo this calls for one of the approved ruling s that go in small print in the rulebook . something like approved ruling if in the judgement of the umpire the runner , by running to the left of the allowed path , caused the fielder to make a bad throw , blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw , or otherwise impedes the defensive team's making a play on him , the batter runner shall be judeged guilty of interference . or approved ruling the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball .  in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor rules trivia question since it cannot be authoritatively answered .  len reed holos software , incorporation voice 404 496 1358 ext . 16 domain uucp

4			politics	afghanistan	america			 pbs frontline iran and the bomb  i would like to share with netters a few points i picked up from the pbs frontline program regarding iran's nuclear activities , aired on tuesday april 13 . for the sake of brevity , i will present them in some separate points . already say it the other week on cbc snoozeworld 1 as many other western programs , this program was laid on a bed of misinformation throughout the program , to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer . some of the misinformations were as follows yeah , i thought bonanza was full of lies about the west .  while the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against iraqi aggression has been officially announced to be about 117 , 000 and even most radical counter revolutionary groups claim that iran and iraq had a total of one million dead , this program claims that iran alone has one million dead left from the war .  the translation of iranian officials talks are not 100 true . for example when iranian head of atomic energy says that it hurts me to see that iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda . the translator says it hurts to see that iran is doing unfriendly research .  2 almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by iranians were of countless dual usage , while the program tries to undermine their non military uses , without any reference to iran's big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power . why the hell would such an oil rich and hydroelectric potential to be exploited spend billions on a nuclear energy programme ? 3 the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of technology as a nuclear research center , while even the cameramen of the program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly closed society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university ! taking in account the scientific advancement of sharif u . in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of iran's industries and eventually the lives of people , it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts .  4 a key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by iaea in their numerous visits from iran's different sites . they say we are not sure if the places visited by iaea are the real ones or not ! or we can not rely on iaea's reports and observation , because they failed to see iraq's nuclear activities before as if they didn not know that iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons ! yeah , and we have every reason in the world to trust the iranian regime . after all , they have been so forward with us in the past . 5 as an extremely personal opinion , the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs , william triplet , in his way of talking , as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge ! maybe he is god ! i hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media , and i hope iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations . hahahahahahaahah ! mohammad   international atomic energy agency

to make your point . overview of contents what is the purpose of this newsgroup ? hitler was an atheist ! the bible proves it pascal's wager what is occam's razor ? why it's good to believe in jesus why i know that god exists einstein and god does not play dice everyone worships something why there must be a causeless cause the universe is so complex it must have been designed independent evidence that the bible is true godel's incompleteness theorem george bush on atheism and patriotism i know where hell is ! biblical contradictions wanted the usa is a christian nation the usa is not a christian nation  what is the purpose of this newsgroup ? typical posting why have a newsgroup about atheism ? why do atheists organize in groups ? what is there to discuss ? response many things are discussed here , including whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's family prayer in schools discrimination against atheists sunday trading laws the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet how religious societies prey sic on new college students how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual why people become atheists of course , inevitably alt . atheism tends to attract evangelical christians looking for someone to convert . most readers of the newsgroup don not want to be preached to , although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill considered or uninformed postings .  hitler was an atheist ! typical posting hitler was an atheist , and look at what he did ! response adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist as he said himself the folkish minded man , in particular , has the sacred duty , each in his own denomination , of making people stop just talking superficially of god's will , and actually fulfill god's will , and not let god's word be desecrated . orig . ital . for god's will gave men their form , their essence , and their abilities . anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the lord's creation , the divine will . therefore , let every man be active , each in his own denomination if you please , and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other . . hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew , i am fighting for the work of the lord orig . ital . adolf hitler , from mein kampf , trans . ralph mannheim . of course , someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong . it's also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in god . we certainly can not conclude that he's an atheist , though .  the bible proves it typical posting in the bible it says that . response most of the readers of alt . atheism feel that the bible is of questionable accuracy , as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before . thus , any claimed not ruth in it is of questionable legitimacy . this isn not to say that the bible has no truth in it ; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted . many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation , any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate . note that this feeling tends to extend to other books . it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion .  pascal's wager typical posting if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect , you have lost nothing but if you don not believe in god and turn out to be incorrect , you will go to hell . therefore it is foolish to be an atheist response this argument is known as pascal's wager . it has several flaws . firstly , it does not indicate which religion to follow . indeed , there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there . this is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem . if a person is a follower of religion x , he may end up in religion y's version of hell . secondly , the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect , you have lost nothing is not true . suppose you are believing in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness . consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer . another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely or at least , that they are of comparable likelihood . if , in fact , the possibility of there being a god is close to zero , the argument becomes much less persuasive . so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already . also , many feel that for intellectually honest people , belief is based on evidence , with some amount of intuition . it is not a matter of will or cost benefit analysis . formally speaking , the argument consists of four statements 1 . one does not know whether god exists . 2 . not believing in god is bad for one's eternal soul if god does exist 3 . believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist 4 . therefore it is in one's interest to believe in god . there are two approaches to the argument . the first is to view 1 as an assumption , and 2 as a consequence of it . one problem with this approach , in the abstract , is that it creates information from no information . this is considered invalid in information theory . statement 1 indicates one has no information about god but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god . this violates information entropy information has been extracted from no information , at no cost . the alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions . the problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the christian position , and only a christian will agree with that assumption . the argument thus collapses to if you are a christian , it is in your interests to believe in god a rather vacuous tautology , and not the way pascal intended the argument to be viewed . the biggest reason why pascal's wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager . he will spurn the latter . assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him .  what is occam's razor ? typical posting people keep talking about occam's razor . what is it ? response william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam's razor . in its original form , it said do not multiply entities unnecessarily . that is , if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity , then do so . nowadays when people refer to occam's razor , they generally express it more generally , for example as take the simplest solution . the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us 1 . there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there , which came into being as a result of natural processes . 2 . there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there , and there is also a god who created the universe . clearly this god must be of non zero complexity . given that both explanations fit the facts , occam's razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one . unfortunately , some argue that there is a third even more simple solution 3 . there isn not an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there . we just imagine that there is . this third option leads us logically towards solipsism , which many people find unacceptable .   why it's good to believe in jesus typical posting i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion . response preaching is not appreciated . feel free to talk about your religion , but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme . such postings do not belong on alt . atheism and will be rejected from alt . atheism . moderated try the newsgroup talk . religion . misc . you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you ; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you ! often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy analogies or parables . be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the basic claims about him ; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that god exists and brings salvation , you may as well not post it , since it tells us nothing we have not been told before .  why i know that god exists typical posting i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists . response just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists , so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist that evidence varies from person to person . furthermore , without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand , many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been abducted by ufos , visited by the ghost of elvis , and so on .  einstein and god does not play dice typical posting albert einstein believed in god . do you think you are cleverer than him ? response einstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe . this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the christian god . used this way , it is out of context ; it refers to einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory . furthermore , einstein's religious background was jewish rather than christian . a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following i believe in spinoza's god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings . einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective , orderly reality ; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer . he believed that qm was incomplete , and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations . so far no such better theory has been found , and much evidence suggests that it never will be . a longer quote from einstein appears in science , philosophy , and religion , a symposium , published by the conference on science , philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life , incorporation , new york , 1941 . in it he says the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature . for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events . to be sure , the doctrine of a personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his , in the real sense , by science , for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot . but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal . for a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark , will of necessity lose its effect on mankind , with incalculable harm to human progress . in their struggle for the ethical good , teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god , that is , give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests . in their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the good , the true , and the beautiful in humanity itself . this is , to be sure , a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task . einstein has also said it was , of course , a lie what you read about my religous convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated . i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly . if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . the latter quote is from albert einstein the human side , edited by helen dukas and banesh hoffman , and published by princeton university press . also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual , and i consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it . of course , the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does not in itself imply that christianity is false .  everyone worships something typical posting everyone worships something , whether it's money , power or god . response if that is true , everyone is a polytheist theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about . if the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists .  why there must be a causeless cause typical posting sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member , so chains of causes must all have a first element , a causeless cause . response the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound , but has no smallest member . further , even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause , that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity , and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion .  the universe is so complex it must have been designed typical posting the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god . surely you don not think all this appeared here just by chance ? response this is known as the argument from design . it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe . those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk . origins for a while . there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here . however , the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so called scientific creationism . furthermore , there is much evidence , observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth . the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as , say , a human is so improbable that surely it can not have come about by chance ; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately . but if human intelligence is so improbable , surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely ? the approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position . this leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe , what created the creator ? but with the addition of spiralling improbability . the only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was . from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator ? indeed stephen hawking , in his book a brief history of time , explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent , with no beginning or end . the argument from design is often stated by analogy , in the so called watchmaker argument . one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach . does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker , or that it evolved naturally ? of course one assumes a watchmaker . yet like the watch , the universe is intricate and complex ; so , the argument goes , the universe too must have a creator . the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws , over and above those common to all arguments by design . firstly , a watchmaker creates watches from pre existing materials , whereas god is claimed to have created the universe from nothing . these two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different , and the analogy is therefore rather weak . secondly , a watchmaker makes watches , but there are many other things in the world . if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor , we wouldn not assume it was created by the watchmaker . the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators , each responsible for a different part of creation . finally , in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered , and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature . yet in the second part of the argument , we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random , but shows elements of order . the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent .  independent evidence that the bible is true typical posting the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence . for example . response the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence . early versions of josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or james ; the extant version discusses john in a non christian context . many scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing , but that this was expanded by christian copyists . several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect . much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius about 320 c . e . it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as not he first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity . it is eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material . aside from the new testament , the biographical information about jesus is more well documented . for further information , please consult the frequently asked questions file for the newsgroup soc . religion . christian .  godel's incompleteness theorem typical posting godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the bible to be both true and complete . response godel's first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic , one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid not rue or false within that formal system . technically speaking , the system must also be recursive ; that is , there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system . essentially , all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar paradox . the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this sentence is false . note that if a proposition is undecidable , the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable . the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined , so claims that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation . one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god , simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom . this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof , however . it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with . it may then be possible to show that godel's incompleteness theorem holds for that system . however , that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists within the system . furthermore , it certainly wouldn not tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally . note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of god ; the formal systems are just abstractions . another frequent claim is that godel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible , the book of mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable . religious texts are not formal systems , so such claims are nonsense .  george bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens ? response the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i . sherman of american atheist press and george bush , on august 27 1988 . sherman is a fully accredited reporter , and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps . the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for illinois . the discussion turned to the presidential primary rs what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists ? gb i guess i m pretty weak in the atheist community . faith in god is important to me . rs surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists ? gb no , i don not know that atheists should be considered as citizens , nor should they be considered patriots . this is one nation under god . rs do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church ? gb yes , i support the separation of church and state . i m just not very high on atheists . upi reported on may 8 , 1989 , that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks . the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february 27 , 1989 . it can also be found in free enquiry magazine , fall 1988 issue , volume 8 , number 4 , page 16 . on october 29 , 1988 , mr. sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane , cochairman of the bush quayle 88 illinois campaign . this concerned a lawsuit mr. sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school district 21 chicago , illinois from forcing his first grade atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as one nation under god bush's phrase . the following conversation took place  rs american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday . does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing ?  em it's bullshit .  rs what is bullshit ?  em everything that american atheists does , rob , is bullshit .  rs thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush campaign is on this issue . em you are welcome . after bush's election , american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract his statement . on february 21st 1989 , c . boyden gray , counsel to the president , replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by as you are aware , the president is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government . for further information , contact american atheist veterans at the american atheist press's cameron road address .  i know where hell is ! typical posting i know where hell is ! hell is in norway ! response there are several towns called hell in various countries around the world , including norway and the usa . whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it , readers of alt . atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week .  biblical contradictions wanted typical posting does anyone have a list of biblical contradictions ? response  american atheist press publish an atheist's handbook detailing biblical contradictions . see the accompanying posting on atheist resources for details . there is a file containing some biblical contradictions available from the . see the contacts file for more information .  the usa is a christian nation typical posting because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers , shouldn not the united states be considered a christian nation ? response based upon the writings of several important founding fathers , it is clear that they never intended the us to be a christian nation . here are some quotes ; there are many more . what influence , in fact , have ecclesiastical establishments had on society ? in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority ; on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny ; in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people . rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries . a just government , instituted to secure and perpetuate it , needs them not . james madison , a memorial and remonstrance , 1785 i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the cross . consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced ! john adams , in a letter to thomas jefferson history i believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government . this marks the lowest grade of ignorance , of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose . thomas jefferson to baron von humboldt , 1813 i cannot conceive otherwise than that he , the infinite father , expects or requires no worship or praise from us , but that he is even infinitely above it . benjamin franklin , from articles of belief and acts of religion , nov . 20 , 1728  the usa is not a christian nation typical posting is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any sense founded upon the christian religion ? response no. the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the 1797 treaty of tripoli 8 stat 154 , treaty series 358 article 11 as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion , as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion or tranquility of musselmen , and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mehomitan nation , it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries . the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections such as charles bevans treaties and other international agreements of the united states of america 1776 1949 , vol . 11 pp . 1070 1080 . the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the u.s. senate on june 7 , 1797 and ratified by president john adams on june 10 , 1797 . it was recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation , it lacks article xi altogether . the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow , consul general at algiers , a close friend of thomas paine and an opponent of christianity . it is possible that barlow made up article xi , but since there is no arabic version of that article to be found , it's hard to say . in 1806 a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation . end of faq digest  ÿ
2			detroit	hockey	coaching	toronto	goal			 wings news and playoff thoughts  i don not think he's shown that he's good enough to carry detroit to the cup . the team may be good enough to reach the finals , but cheveldae is their achilles heel . you must have goaltending in the playoffs , and cheveldae looks like an overmatched 2nd or 3rd stringer which he probably  i guess i don not know of too many 2nd or 3rd string goalies that could post over 30 wins in a season . chevy has done that the past two seasons playing behind a defense that is not exactly the best in the league . his 34 wins this year were not all against toronto and for those who look at vincent rien . stats and think he should be starting , take a look at the teams he played against teams like san jose , ottawa , and tb any nhl goalie could post a decent record playing teams like that night in and night out .  is . look for detroit management to remedy the situation in the offseason .  i really don not see this happening . if they didn not think cheveldae could do the job they would of traded for somebody this year , after all why wait until next year when there were goalies available this year .  hey , i may be wrong , but after watching him kick rebound after rebound into the high slot , i don not think he can carry them in the tough games i.e. those not against toronto .  better to kick out rebounds than to let goals in .  if st louis gets past chicago , watch for joseph to carry the blues past an otherwise vastly superior red wings club .  joseph is hot , but so are the wings . they have scored six goals in both of their games so far with toronto , supposively one of the leagues best defenses . i guess if they end up playing for the norris title we will see what happens .    dr.d the devils advocate drinkin & women & guns don not mix .  mark arm   kcs  wings in 93 , or hopefully by 94 . as far as cheveldae is concerned , he is a decent goalie . the most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers . i m sure if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his roots in detroit . he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the rangers could get a zombo in return ? beezer got a few good years in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play .

4			trust	greed	ethic	capitalism			 legality of the jewish purchase  amir y rosenblatt writes sam zbib writes no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity . palestinians are no exception . perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business world .  since we are debating the legality of a commercial and ethics of such transactions . basic anti trust law says that , while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing , you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm . you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori . clearly , the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs , they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate . they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews .  the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality . being a multi ethnic multi religious society , accepting the jews as neighbours was no different , just another religion . plus they paid fair market value , etc . they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy . i m not a conspiracy theorist myself , but this one is hard to dismiss .   right now , i m just going to address this point . when the jewish national fund bought most of its land , it didn not buy it from the palestinians themselves , because , for the most part , they were tenant farmers fallahin , living on land owned by wealthy arabs in syria and lebanon . the jnf offered a premium deal , so the owners took advantage of it . it's called commerce . the owners , however , made no provisions for those who had worked for them , basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them . they are to blame , not the jews .    amir why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting ? was it because it was sold to jews ? was it fair to assume that the fallahin would be mistreated by the jews ? is this the norm of any commerce read shafting between arabs and jews ? it was shafting on the part of the arab land owners for doing it without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible enough to make provisions for them , but rather just leaving them to their fate .  your claim that the lebanese syrian landlords sold palestine if true , even partially omits the fact that the mandate treaty put lebanon and syria under french rule , while palestine under british . obiviously , any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in palestine and would be motivated to sell , regardless of the price . the point is that the land was sold legally , often at prices above its actual value . it was legal , and good business for the sellers , though it left the palestinians who worked the land in a poor situation .  it is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted . do many israelis or jews share your opinion ? do you absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasn not written down ? i don not know if others share this opinion . it is mine , and i m sure there are some who agree and some who don not the way i see it , the fallahin were caught in circumstances beyond their control , in that since they didn not own the land , they didn not have a say . of course , now for the sake of the greater arab unity the arabs are angry that the land was sold to the jews an act that is illegal in jordan , but when it happened , it was just business .  all told , i did not see an answer in your response . the question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets land , infra structure etc . imho the palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase , say in world court .  sam  my opinions are my own and no one else's the purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for jewish immigrants . in any case , no matter what the purpose , the sales were legal , so i really don not see any grounds for contesting them . amir

4			gun	violence	conspiracy	freedom	murder			 letter to a liberal colleague l . neil smith posted by cathy smith for l . neil smith letter to a liberal colleague author's note adrian name changed to protect the guilty and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous new york publishing house . dear adrian i m way behind schedule on my current book again , so this reply to your note criticizing the recent magazine interview i gave and generally attacking gun ownership will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you are free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic i have neither time nor energy to present now . i have written fully on this topic before and will again in the future . when i do , i will make sure you get copies . there are many arguments i might make , from the futility and danger of delegating self defense to the police see don kates in the jan . 10 , 1985 wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition , shifting consumers from newly outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed off shotguns or homemade bombs , but i will limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note . first , the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . second , publication of some latter day scientific study doesn not alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my interview annoying you so much in the process were lying . third , the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . fourth , as often happens with these things , the study doesn not support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway , but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies , omissions , and distortions . fifth , the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . sixth , the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions carl bakal , author of no right to keep and bear arms , even confessed to it publicly makes the value of this present study dubious , to say the least seventh , the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . eighth , given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction , you should be better aware than most people how progress in designing studies to prove whatever you want outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data . a case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create studies proving that pornography causes crime . more naive and probably more honest efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary . ninth , the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . tenth , another reason to doubt all such studies is that human behavior as the austrian school of economics demonstrates is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified . the attempt to do so and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo information is wrecking our civilization . eleventh , the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . twelfth , the study is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide , which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right , sometimes with ancillary social benefits . if anything , perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense . thirteenth and finally , the national rifle association officials quoted in the article , whatever their shortcomings and they are many , are correct in this instance the study is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural , fundamental , and inalienable human , individual , civil , and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility . and because of that , adrian , even if the study were valid , it wouldn not deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however , whenever , and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission . in this i m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves , whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun while they still can . before the 68 gun control act , most of the shooting fraternity viewed handguns incorrectly , as it turned out as inaccurate , ineffective toys . there probably weren not six million of them in the whole country . now , thanks to kennedy , metzenbaum , the bradys , and their ilk america's greatest sporting goods sales team we probably manufacture at least that many every year . the fascinating datum is that handgun control , et al . are perfectly aware of this so i guess you will have to ask them yourself what their real motives are . look gun making isn not an arcane or difficult art and by the way , it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic ; the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference , the self loading pistol , is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further . even if it were difficult , there are already a quarter billion firearms in america , with an estimated half life of 1000 years possibly more for stainless steel . guns are gonna be around a long time , adrian , whether you like it or not . as for me , to paraphrase elmer keith , regardless of what the law provides or any court decides , i m always going to be armed . and i will always work to see that others are , as well . the bad news is that there are thousands more perhaps even

2			canada	sport	detroit	hockey	football	baseball	coaching	toronto			 don cherry coach's corner summary april 23 , 1993 here's a summary of don cherry's coach's corner from april 23 , 1993 . it was taken from a tape delay of a vancouver winnipeg game , but it was filmed during the toronto detroit game that night . i think it was also shown during the calgary la game . warning . anti fighting people may want to skip this post topics  don's tie , doug gilmour , wings leafs , quebec montreal , boston buffalo , wendel clark , fighting and stickwork . episode summary  once again , the episode started with a shot of don's tie . this was a different tie than last time . don pointed out some of the characters on the tie , but gave them different names . felix the cat sylverster , maclean daffy duck , etc. ron maclean asked don what he thought of the current wings leafs game . don thought it was good . burns told the leaf players they won in their building , we are going to win in ours . don then began to praise gilmour again . don pointed out that gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against st louis . don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to gilmour , which was partly responsible for his good play . several clips were then shown of gilmour from the series . a hit on constantinov , and a pass to andrewchuk resulting in a goal . on the game itself , the wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period . the wings have enough talent to score short handed however , and when the leafs get a power play , coach burns tells the leaf players don not let them score on you . ron brought up the previous quebec montreal game . note montreal won that game in overtime , despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick . don thought the high stick was obvious , even without the use of instant replay . on the buffalo boston series note buffalo is currently winning the series 3 0 , don gave full credit to goaltender grant fuhr . fuhr should be getting 1 2 the team's playoff checks for his play . wendel clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the detroit toronto series . don defended him , by saying that he can not play the way he should , because of the league's new rules . this used to be a rough and tough league . now its all hack and slash . don lays the blame on gil stien for the problems. don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by wings gm and coach bryan murray . a clip from a news conference by murray was shown , in which murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork . don also read a newspaper article in which murray makes the following statements players don not fight because they are afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator . instead , they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other . is this what the fans want to see ? i guarantee there wouldn not be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game . don warned league commisioner gary bettman to smarten up with fighting in hockey . he went on to say that before , there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series . now , with no fights , someone gets cut every period . rating  typical anti fighting posturing , but here don's opinion is supported by murray . i would give it a 7 . 0 out of 10 .

3			radar	radio	antenna	time	navigation	space			 can radio freq . be used to measure distance ?  i m wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver ?  yes . it's called radar . well , actually not quite . both radar and radio altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal , then receive its reflection from a target . radar generally uses pulses , while radio altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous wave transmission . in the case of the latter , highly accurate distance measurement can be made . as an example , the original bendix ala 52 radio altimeter was accurate to 1 8 foot at 2500 feet altitude . note , however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about . the problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers . this cannot be wire connected , since radio waves will actually travel faster in free space air , in this case than wire the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable . so you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance , etc. something like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick , triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously . sound expensive ? not too bad , but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort . why not go to a different method ? surveyors use a laser light system where again the reflection time is measured . why not try this ? sounds like something a p . e . should know about anyway ; seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance . this would be for short distances 2000 ft , and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so . this is actually highly inaccurate , since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit , there are variances in the antenna and transmission line , and the receiver may also vary , both from unit to unit , and the same unit over time . you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system . with the radio altimeter this is also done , but since everything is located at one place , it is much easier to do . note especially that the time base for the r . a . receiver and transmitter is one unit also . depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes , in a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this concept . nope . fm capture effect says that the strongest signal wins . that is , unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength . this is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes . signals bouncing off runways tend to be very strong . what frequencies would be best for this ? or does matter ? as high as possible to eliminate outside influence , and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals . radio altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 ghz . hope this helps .   jack brindle ham radio wa4fib internet

4			firearm	gun	violence	politics	weapon	war	safety			 some more about gun control . re is john q . public with a gun protected ? it's worth noting that us vs . miller sustained miller's conviction of possession of an illegal firearm , noting that a sawed off shotgun was not a proper militia weapon . no , they noted that no one had claimed that it was a proper militia weapon despite having been used in at least two wars . this was true , since neither miller nor his lawyer appeared before the court . did they or did they not sustain miller's conviction ? i don not have the text of the case handy . miller was convicted of owning a sawed off shotgun and not paying the nfa 34 tax . snatches of the court's decision the second amendment was intended to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such a force the militia . it must be interpreted and applied with that end in view . the militia includes all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense . however , regarding sawed off shotguns , certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense . judicial notice is the term of art here it meant that no such evidence had been formally presented . this is different from claiming that they had ruled that it wasn not . yes , shotguns had been used in wwi , the spanish american war , and the us civil war . that was not in question . the possession of a sawed off shotgun was , i.e . a weapon altered to improve concealibility . i m not talking about plain shotguns in war i m talking about short barrelled sawed off shotguns in war . compare revolutionary war blunderbusses ; luparas in the spanish american war ; and trench cleaners in ww i . they were also put to good use by us soldiers in ww ii , not to mention being invaluable to tunnel rats in vietnam , but , of course , miller took place in 1939 . therefore , us vs . miller supports limited government regulation of firearms.  don not go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by the consequences that you find at the end of it mainly , that the law abiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia purpose , from handguns to sawed off shotguns and fully automatic weapons . that , in fact , is what this decision says .  you are free to produce evidence that i m not willing to abide with all the implications of this . here is my quandary you seem to be arguing that certain types of guns fall outside the scope of the second . this isn not a useful argument unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class . i think we both agree that zip guns probably aren not protected . maybe we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments have been banning or trying to ban because they have no sporting purpose and no provate citizen would ever need these guns do fall under the protection of the second . so , given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at some time been used by the military , even if only for marksmanship training purposes , i need to understand why you are intent on pressing this point , arguing that that something is not protected by the second . just because i don not whole heartedly endorse the nra position does not mean that i oppose the rkba . this attitude is what makes the nra unpopular . often , what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him . how much did any of us fear or abhor the branch davidians six months ago ? how many of us feared or abhorred saddam hussein five years ago ?  if you believe that i speak for my company , or write today for my special investors packet .

1			ethernet	computer	networking	bus	isa	hardware			 ide vs scsi how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus ? by initiating a dma xfer . seriously , busmastering adapter have their own dma ability , they don not use the motherboards on board dma which is much slower . isa has no bus arbitration , so if two busmastering cards in 1 isa system try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or crash . i forget their are 8 dma channels in an isa system . 0 7 . 0 3 are 8 bit & 4 7 are 16 bit . the system uses dma 0 , a soundblaster uses dma 1 . i could buy a busmastering xga 2 video card & a busmastering scsi ha . in order for them to work properly , i would have to find out what dma channel the xga 2 card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to use a different dma channel for its dma xfers . i don not know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa . i m not sure if they can on eisa systems either . i do know that on eisa mca systems , you can allow bm cards to use the same dma channel . thanks .
5			faith	religion	islam	muslim	jihad	god			 yet more rushdie re islamic law the intent of my post as i remember it was to show that you cannot argue against any religion or ideology , for that matter by the actions of those who claim to be its followers . you have to look at the teachings of the religion or the principles of the ideology itself . there is no getting around this .  so to argue against islam , you have to go to the qur an . bringing up khomeini or anyone else is relevant to discussing khomeini , but not necessarily relevant to discussing islam as a religion . sorry , fred , but for the purposes under discussion here , i must disagree . your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet empires , since those did not represent true communism . in judging the practical consequences of islam as a force to contend with in the world today , it is precisely the khomeini's of the world , the rushdie fatwa supporters , and perhaps more importantly , the reaction of the world muslim community to those extremists , that we must look to . perhaps unfortunately from your perspective , most people are not concerned with whether islam is the right religion for them , or whether the qur an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia , but how islam affects the world around them , or what their lives might be like if islam gains in influence . when i consider such possibilities , it is with not inconsiderable fear .  jim perry decision support , incorporation , matthews nc these are my opinions . for a nominal fee , they can be yours .

that was the question i asked a . c . brocki , editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system . mr. brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud , a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of american usage and style the consensus . a little research lent support to brocki's opinion of professor copperud's expertise . roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17 year career teaching journalism at usc . since 1952 , copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher , a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field . he's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary , and merriam webster's usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert . copperud's fifth book on usage , american usage and style the consensus , has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since 1981 , and is the winner of the association of american publisher's humanities award that sounds like an expert to me . after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested , i sent the following letter i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage , to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution , and extract the intent from the text . the text of the second amendment is , a well regulated militia , being necessary for the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence , a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause , with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence , not he right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy , but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent . further , since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment , i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation , and even be willing to testify under oath to support , if necessary . my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment , then concluded i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter . i am doing so because , as a citizen , i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment . while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results , i ask that you do this because of that importance . after several more letters and phone calls , in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis , but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment , gun control , or any other political subject , professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity copperud the words a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july 26 , 1991 , constitutes a present participle , rather than a clause . it is used as an adjective , modifying militia , which is followed by the main clause of the sentence subject not he right , verb shall . the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia . in reply to your numbered questions schulman 1 can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to a well regulated militia ? copperud 1 the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms , nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people ; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people . schulman 2 is not he right of the people to keep and bear arms granted by the words of the second amendment , or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms , and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed ? copperud 2 the right is not granted by the amendment ; its existence is assumed . the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia . schulman 3 is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia , is , in fact necessary to the security of a free state , and if that condition is not existing , is the statement not he right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed null and void ? copperud 3 no such condition is expressed or implied . the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia . no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state . the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence . schulman 4 does the clause a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , grant a right to the government to place conditions on the right of the people to keep and bear arms , or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence ? copperud 4 the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional , as previously stated . it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia . schulman 5 which of the following does the phrase well regulated militia mean well equipped , well organized , well drilled , well educated , or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority ? copperud 5 the phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority ; this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military . schulman 6 if at all possible , i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words , or usage , since that sentence was written 200 years ago , but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors , unless those issues can be clearly separated . copperud to the best of my knowledge , there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment . if it were written today , it might be put since a well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged . schulman as a 'scientific control on this analysis , i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence , a well schooled electorate , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and read books , shall not be infringed . my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be , 1 is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other , identical to the second amendment's sentence ? and 2 could this sentence be interpreted to restrict not he right of the people to keep and read books only to a well educated electorate for example , registered voters with a high school diploma ? copperud 1 your 'scientific control sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure . 2 there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation . professor copperud had only one additional comment , which he placed in his cover letter with well known human curiosity , i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used , but was unable to reach any conclusion . so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms , forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right . as i write this , the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed , apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power . and here in the united states , elected lawmakers , judges , and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore , marginalize , or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely . american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms , owning arms of forbidden sorts , or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms , guaranteed by the constitution . and even the american civil liberties union aclu , staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights , stands by and does nothing . it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right . no one else will . no one else can . will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights , and continue regarding them as representing us if they do ? will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment doesn not mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak ? or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice , as the constitution of the united states promises us we can , and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives , our fortuned , and our sacred honor ?

1			optimization	python	windows	java			 using microsoft foundation classes with borland c 3 . 1 hi all ,  has anybody tried to compile ctrltest from the mfc samples directory , after compiling the mfc libs with bwc ?  seems to me , that bwc isn not able to distinguish pointers to overloaded functions . for example , imagine the following 2 overloaded functions void same name void void same name int  after trying the whole day , i think , with bwc its impossible to take the adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined function pointer . am i right ? has anybody else had this problem ?  thanx i think you may be chasing the wrong problem . i don not think it is the function overloading at all i do that sort of thing all of the time in bc without a hitch . the big problems i have encountered in porting mfc to bc is that fact that mfc depends on a couple of invalid c assumptions . i have never gotten the entire ctrltest app to run under bc , but the reason is that ms makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static global objects are initialized i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized . the problem is in the owner draw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section , all other pieces of ctrltest work fine . two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc the cfile openflags enum uses hard coded numbers for the open mode , rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl . h which differ between msc and bc . all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place of a reference to a derived object true for pointers , not for references . not encountered them yet . i have not seen mfc 2 . 0 yet , but i hope that some of these will be addressed . if they are not , all of ms's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that .  if these were my employer's opinions , i wouldn not be posting them .  whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously r . brendler not a cubs fan . mike royko spss , incorporation chicago il
3			diabetes	science	health	nutrition	obesity	dr			 pms can it be prevented by a diet change ? this question came up in sci . med . nutrition and i m posting my answer here . only 22 medical schools in the u.s. teach courses on human nutrition . we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community . i think that the best example of where u.s. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms. so many women and their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u.s. are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening . before shooting your flames , read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified . from a poster in sci . medi . nutrition in a psychological anthropology course i am taking , we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms. some rumors shared by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels , sugar intake , and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms. is there any data on this , or is it just so much hooey ?  many thanks ,  michael , i have wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i got side tracked with candida . pms is a lot like candida blooms , most physicians don not recognize it as a specific disease entity . here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms. premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups pmt a anxiety pmt d depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy pmt c craving pmt h hyperhydration craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness 1 . headache edema of the face and extremities 2 . palpitations 3 . fatigue or fainting  pmt a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle . pmt c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates . during the luteal phase of a women's cycle , there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge . the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e1 . this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia , magnesium and pge1 seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia . a . am . j . psychiatry 147 4 477 80 1990 . unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar , magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation increased to 5 6 of the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid . pmt d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle . another cause of pmt d has been found to be lead toxicity in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase . effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol fertil . steril . 28 312 18 1972 . pmt h is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level . salt restriction , b6 , magnesium and vitamin e for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating pmt h this general discussion of the pms syndromes came form a . management of the premenstrual tension sundromes rational for a nutritional approach . 1986 , a year in

tension , prob . obstet . gynecol . 3 12 1 39 1980 treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pms just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms . while progesterone will work , supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better . there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms much more than candida blooms . many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done . here are a few of these studies carbohydrate experimental controlled study , effect of a low fat , high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy lancet 2 128 32 1988 . 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15 of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training . after 6 months , there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling , tenderness and nodularity . vitamin a experimental controlled study , the use of vitamin a in premenstrual tension acta obstet . gynecol scand . 39 586 92 1960 . 218 pts with severe recurring pms received 200 , 000 to 300 , 000iu vitamin a daily or a placebo . serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured serum retinol above 450ug ml . the intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin a and get a normal pool size 500 , 000iu to 1 , 000 , 000iu and then see if this normal vitamin a pool could prevent pms. 48 getting the high dose vitamin a had complete remission of the symptoms of pms. only 10 getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of pms sysmptoms. 10 of the vitamin a treated group reported no improvement in pms symptoms. experimental controlled study , premenstrual tension treated with vitamin a j . clinical endocrinology 10 1579 89 1950 . 30 pts received 200 , 000iu of vitamin a daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of pms symptoms. after 2 6 months , all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in pms symptoms. vitamin a supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin a supplementation was stopped . pms symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin a supplementation was stopped . most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver . these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms. of all the vitamins given for pms vitamin a , b6 , and vitamin e , vitamin a has shown the best single effect . this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the liver . getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of pms. but vitamin a is toxic and you don not want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a toxicity . vitamin b6 experimental double blind crossoverr study , pyridoxine vitamin b6 and the premenstrual syndrome a randomized crossover trial j . r . coll . gen . pract . 39 364 68 1989 . 32 women aged 18 49 with moderate to severe pms randomly received 50mg b6 daily or placebo . after 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months . b6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of pms depression , irritability and tiredness . other symptoms of pms were not significanttly affected by b6 supplementation . experimental double blind study , the efects of vitamin b6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms obstet . gynecol 70 2 145 49 1987 . 55 pts with moderate to severe pms received 150mg b6 daily or placebo for 2 months . analysis of convergence showed that b6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system dizziness and vomiting as well as behavior changes poor mental performance , decreased social interaction anxiety , depression and water retention were not improved by b6 supplementation . vitamin b6 is below the rda for both american men and women . birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the b6 requirement in man . women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10 15 mg of b6 per day . the dose should be increased if symptoms of pms appear . dr. david r . rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of nimh was quoted in clin . psychiatry news , december , 1987 as stating that b6 should be considered the first line drug for pms over progesterone and if the patient does not respond , then other treatments should be tried . vitamin b6 can be toxic nerve damage if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day . vitamin e experimental double blind study , efficacy of alpha tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome j . reprod . med . 32 6 400 04 1987 . 35 pts received 400iu vitamin e daily for 3 cycles or a placebo . vitamin e treated pts had 33 who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms weight gain and breast tenderness while the placebo group had 14 who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms. the vitamin e group reported that 38 had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12 for the placebo group . for depression , the vitamin e group had 27 with a significant decrease in depression compared with 8 for the placebo group . experimental double blind study , the effect of alpha tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy a double blind study j . am . coll . nutr . 2 2 115 122 1983 . 75pts with benign breast disease and pmt randomly received vitamin e at 75iu , 150iu , or 300iu daily or placebo . after 2 months of supplementation , 150iu of vitamin e or higher significantly improved pmt a and pmt c . the 300iu dose was needed to significantly improve pmt d . no dose of vitamin e significantly improved pmt h other studies have shown that a higher vitamin e doses will relieve pmt h symptoms .  magnesium experimental double blind study , magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine effects on itracellular magnesium headache 31 298 304 1991 . 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo . treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation . after 2 months , the pain total index was significantly lower in the magnesium group . magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the menstrual distress questionnaire scores . pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from pms. after treatment , magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range . experimental double blind study , oral magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes obstet . gynecol 78 2 177 81 1991 . 32pts aged 24 39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow . after 2 cycles , both groups received magnesium . the menstrual distress questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle month for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation . in addition , the total score on the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation . the authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during pms. there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature . but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci . med . to be anecdotal in nature , i have not bothered to cite them . there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms. i have chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder . but doctors don not recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology beri beri , pellagra , scruvy , etc . pms is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the u.s. should get a good course on human nutrition . pms is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders . it's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses . here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin mineral supplementation and or diet change in preventing pms. experimental study , effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome a retrospective analysis , complement . med . res . 5 1 8 11 1991 . 200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with optivite r plus additional vitamin c , vitamin e , magnesium , zinc and primrose oil . the dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat , complex carbohydrate diet . on a retrospective analysis , 96 . 5 of the 200pts reported an improvement in their pms symptoms with 30 of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from pms. experimental double blind study , role of nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes , j reprod . med . 32 6 405 22 1987 . a low fat , high complex carbohydrate diet along with optivite supplementation significantly decreased pms scores compared with diet change and placebo . after 6 months on the

5			morality	ethic	scripture			 deuterocanonicals , esp . sirach lets talk about principles . if we accept that god sets the standards for what ought to be included in scripture then we can ask 1 . is it authoritative ? authoritative is not a quality of the writing itself it is a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative . 2 . is it prophetic ? how is prophecy to be defined ? if it is speaking forth of god's message , much of the apocrypha must surely qualify . 3 . is it authentic ? again , by what standard ? is authenticity a function of the authors ? the historical accuracy ? 4 . is it dynamic ? what is this supposed to mean ? many of the apocryphal books are highly dynamic thought provoking , faithful , even exciting . 5 . is it received , collected , read and used ? by whom ? of course the apocryphal books were received by some , collected or else we would not have them , read and used and they still are , in the catholic and orthodox churches . on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god . this is demonstrably false . to quote unger's bible dictionary on the apocrapha 1 . they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. so do other books of the bible . 2 . they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred scripture . false by whose interpretation ? those churches that accept them find no contradiction with the rest of scripture . 3 . they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture . this is a purely subjective evaluation . the apocryphal books demonstrate the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures . in fact , one could argue that the apocryphal additions to the book of esther act rather to bring the unscripturelike book of esther more into line with other books . 4 . they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling . have you ever read the wisdom of ben sira or the wisdom of solomon ? they exhibit every bit as much poetic and religious feeling as psalms or proverbs . deletions how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to them , god will add to him the plagues described in this book . and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy , god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev 22 . 18 9 surely this sets the standard and not just man made traditions . these words clearly were meant to refer to the book of revelation alone , not to the whole body of scripture . revelation itself was accepted very late into the canon . the church simply did not see it as having a primary role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture . it is also noteworthy to consider jesus attitude . he had no argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon john 10 . 31 6 , and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus that in the law , prophets and psalms which referred to him the ot division of scripture luke 24 . 44 , as well as in luke 11 . 51 taking genesis to chronicles the jewish order we would say genesis to malachi as scripture . jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day , the canon had not been established as a closed collection . the books of the apocrypha were part of the septuagint which was the bible of the early church . the hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c . e . the torah pentateuch law was established in jesus day , as were the prophets with the exclusion of daniel . the writings , however , were still in flux . jesus does not refer to the writings , only to the psalms , which were part of them . the books of the apocrypha were all part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated . to argue that jesus is referring to the jewish canonical order in luke 11 51 is weak at best ; he is not quoting scripture , but telling a chronological story . and , as mentioned above , the hebrew canon especially in the present order did not exist as such in jesus day .

4			woman	gay	homosexuality	sex	sexuality	men			 why not concentrate on child molesters ?  well , the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits if the oppertunity presented itself ?  i reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a huge variety of willing partners .  if true , and if gays were the same as straights except for sexual preference , i would imagine that gays would have much less sex than straights because the available pool for dates is less than one tenth what it is for straights . somebody correct flame me please ! i cannot believe i am posting in this thread , but what the hell , he asked for it . i had sort of the same reaction myself when i was first realizing i was bi . so what , 90 of everyone else is straight , i would never end up with a guy anyway . as several people on soc . bi pointed out to me , this is true only if you find partners for relationships or just for sex in primarily straight circles . nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such , you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose . about half my friends are bi , and that's just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to ucbu once a week , it's not as if i have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something . so the available pool for dates can be the same size . unless of course you are trying to date a random sample of the us population . as for promiscuity , i have traded email with clayton on the topic , and he still doesn not seem to want to admit that yes , gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they are closeted and can not afford to be seen in a permanent relationship . or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed up gender roles in our society , and when males are dating males and they have all been trained to be the aggressor in sex , there's going to be more sex . or that what's dysfunctional , what's screwed up is societal attitudes , not gay sexuality , and that's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males . also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners doesn not mean they are promiscuous . yes , it sounds ridiculous , but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers , and then come out , start forming real relationships , and be monogamous or nearly so .  alan jaffray email , not alk always welcome . bi those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music anon b0h7f t w cg k ? s vm h ps6 3bgz o x v j n0178l a f vn e dvb u

3			electronics	noise	sound	audio			 pink noise  pink noise and white noise are equal amounts of all frequencies . this is in most cases around the 20 3 . 3k hz range . pink white are used to adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that . there are a few eq's out on the market that have pink noise built in . most all from audio control have them i know the c 101 does .  with regards to what you wrote , how does one adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that ? i asked a professor that question just last week and he didn not really know himself . since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states say , the surface of the silicon where there's a lack of a covalent bond that act as traps to nearby elecrons , and since this happens at low frequencies because at high frequencies they aren not able to trap electrons , how do you compensate for that ? it seems to me that you wouldn not be able to compensate for pink noise . i have seen the pink noise feature , however , on many eqs , and i was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to any information about this , it would be appreciated . hope this didn not sound too drawn out . thanx .  david

5			baptism	pregnancy	jesus	religion	christianity	sex	baby	god			 the doctrine of original sin if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn not the bible ever say so . it never comes right and says only people that know right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised . this is not a very sound argument for baptising babies . it assumes that if the bible doesn not say specifically that you don not need to do something , then that must mean that you do need to do it . i know there's a specific term for this form of logic , but it escapes me right now . however , if it were sound , then you should be able to apply it this way ; if the bible doesn not specifically say that something is wrong , then it must be ok , which , coincidentally , leads perfectly into a question i have often pondered . if slavery is immoral which i believe it is , can i assume that everyone else in this group does too ? why doesn not jesus or any of the apostles speak out against it ? owning slaves was common practice back then . paul speaks about everything else that is immoral . he apparently thought it was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard why doesn not anyone mention slavery ? if god's morals are eternal and don not change like the morals of society , then it must have been just as immoral then as it is today .

5			jesus	faith	religion	christ	prayer	god			 does god love you ? i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract . it is a bit lengthy for a posting , but i thought i would share it with all of you anyway . feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says . may god richly bless those who read it .    d o e s g o d l o v e y o u ?   q . what kind of question is that ? anyone who can read sees signs , tracts , books , and bumper stickers that say , god loves you . isn not that true ?  a . it is true that god offers his love to the whole world , as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible  for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . john 3 16  however , god's love is qualified . the bible says  the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness . proverbs 15 9  for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish . psalm 1 6   q . but i am not wicked . i am a decent , moral person . surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done . how can these verses apply to me ?  a . by god's standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell . the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven . on the contrary , we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god .  as it is written , there is none righteous , no , not one there is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after god . romans 3 10 11  the heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked who can know it ? jeremiah 17 9   q . if i am such a wicked person in god's sight , what will god do to me ?  a . the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell .  for a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains . i will heap mischiefs upon them ; i will spend mine arrows upon them . they shall be burnt with hunger , and devoured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy 32 22 24   q . oh , come on now ! hell is not real , is it ? surely things are not that bad .  a . indeed , hell is very real , and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior . the bible makes many references to hell , indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering .  and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire . revelation 20 15  so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just , and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth . matthew 13 49 50  . when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels , in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god , and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord , and from the glory of his power ; 2 thessalonians 1 7 9   q . that is terrible ! why would god create a hell ?  a . hell is terrible , and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions . god's perfect justice demands payment for sin .  for the wages of sin is death ; romans 6 23  for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad . 2 corinthians 5 10  but i say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment . matthew 12 36   q . does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell ?  a . indeed it does ; that is , unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins . that someone is god himself , who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him .  all we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all . isaiah 53 6  but he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed . isaiah 53 5  for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received , how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ; and that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 1 corinthians 15 3 4  for he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of god in him . 2 corinthians 5 21   q . are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute , who was already punished for my sins , then i will not have to worry about hell anymore ?  a . yes , this is so ! if i have believed in christ as my savior , then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god . christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins .  he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life ; but the wrath of god abideth on him . john 3 36   q . but what does it mean to believe on him ? if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior , then am i saved from going to hell ?  a . believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible . it means that we hang our whole lives on him . it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible . it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord  no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye cannot serve god and mammon . matthew 6 24  repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord ; acts 3 19   q . are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus ? what about all the other religions ? will their followers also go to hell ?  a . yes , indeed . they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins . god demands that we pay for our sins . other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers . christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us .  neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved . acts 4 12  jesus said  i am the way , the truth , and the life no man cometh unto the father , but by me . john 14 6  if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . 1 john 1 9   q . now i am desperate . i do not want to go to hell . what can i do ?  a . you must remember that god is the only one who can help you . you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god . as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner , cry out to god to save you .  and the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , god be merciful to me a sinner . luke 18 13  . sirs , what must i do to be saved ? and they said , believe on the lord jesus christ , and thou shalt be saved , acts 16 30 31   q . but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him ?  a . wonderfully , god not only saves us through the lord jesus , but he also gives us the faith to believe on him . you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior .  for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians 2 8  god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith . so , if you really mean business with god about your salvation , you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible , which is the only word of god . in this brochure , all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs . give heed to them with all your heart .  so then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of god . romans 10 17   q . but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god ?  a . yes . god wants us to come to him in total humility , acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness , trusting totally in him .  the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart , o god , thou wilt not despise . psalm 51 17  because we are sinners we love our sins . therefore , we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins . and if we sincerely desire salvation , we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us . we know that our sins are sending us to hell .  unto you first god , having raised up his son jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities . acts 3 26   q . doesn not the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized ? will these save me ?  a . if possible , we should do these things , but they will not save us . no work of any kind can secure our salvation . salvation is god's sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure . salvation is  not of works , lest any man should boast ephesians 2 9   q . what else will happen at the end of the world ?  a . those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more .  for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord 1 thessalonians 4 16 17   q . what will happen to the earth at that time ?  a . god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more .  but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up . nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness . 2 peter 3 10 , 13   q . does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come ?  a . yes ! the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save .  and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come . matthew 24 14   q . can we know how close to the end of the world we might be ?  a . yes ! god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved , it will not come as a thief for the believers . there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very , very close . all the time clues in the bible point to this .  for when they shall say , peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape . 1 thessalonians 5 3  surely the lord god will do nothing , but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets . amos 3 7   q . but that means judgment day is almost here .  a . yes , it does . god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning .  and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey , and he cried , and said , yet forty days , and nineveh shall be overthrown . jonah 3 4   q . what did the people of nineveh do ?  a . from the king on down they humbled themselves before god , repented of their sins , and cried to god for mercy .  but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto god yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands . who can tell if god will turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ? jonah 3 8 9   q . did god hear their prayers ?  a . yes . god saved a great many people of nineveh .   q . can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg ment ?  a . yes . there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short .  how shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ; hebrews 2 3  in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in god . trust in him at all times ; ye people , pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us . psalm 62 7 8     a r e y o u r e a d y t o m e e t g o d ?

tract printed by , and available free of charge from , family radio . a number of minor changes have been made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and distribution . the only change to the text itself is the paragraph which describes the way in which biblical passages appear within the text . in the original tract they appear in italic lettering ; they appear here as indented paragraphs .   i have read mr. camping's book , compared it with what the bible actual ly says , find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that i have ever come across , and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore . while none of us is guaranteed one more second of life , and while we , therefore , should take these matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return , it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless now because , in all likelihood , the law of averages with respect to life expectancy no longer applies . if you wish to obtain a copy of this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself , you may find the following information helpful  title 1994 ?

4			firearm	gun	violence	politics	ethic	safety	murder			 gun control  i would be surprised if there weren not contrary studies . i might add that sloan and kellerman was endorsed by the police departments of both seattle and vancouver and is considered by most of the references i have at hand the most exhaustive study of its kind , even by those who take issue with some of the essay's conclusions . s&k's statistics speak largely for themselves without postulate . and , i might add , vitamin c has been endorsed by a nobel laureate as a panacea for almost everything from the common cold to cancer . in order to compare violent crime trends , s&k compared all violent crime categories , from simple assault through various mechanisms of homicide . wait a minute . s&k did not compare trends . if they did , they would have seen that the advent of canada's gun law had no effect on homicides , total or handgun . without a pre vs . post comparison , one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything . all they have is a correlation , and correlation does not prove causality . if your point is that non whites commit more handgun crimes than whites then yours is the dubious assumption . conventional social theory is that economic status , not color , is the primary motivating factor for crime , especially violent crime . what's your point anyway , that white people are more responsible gun owners ? should we assume that it's a coincidence that there are comparitively fewer white people earning below the poverty line and living in tenement neighborhoods where most violent crime occurs ? hold it again . you dismiss a point about demographics , then you ask about socio economic demographics ? very slick .  differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable .  on the contrary , it's these differences that are the very basis of the study the easy availability of legal handguns in seattle and the much more difficult restricted weapons permit required in vancouver . once again , correlation does not prove causality . looking at pre vs . post data , the canadian gun law had no effect .  not so . cook measures suicides and assaultive homicides with firearms against a survey based estimate of the number of legal and illegal guns in circulation within a city . sir , if you were a canadian , and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed , and decided to hide it rather than turn it in , would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls , writes , or asks you on the street ? that is one problem with surveys . nobody will answer an incriminating question . another is that people will often tell you what they think you want to here .  again , your author misses the core issue that vancouver citizens are prohibited from purchasing handguns on the basis of self defense . they don not have a choice in the matter . does that mean no vancouver citizens have handguns ? i think not . you are discounting guns purchased beforehand , and guns purchased for purposes other than self defense , which can also be used for defense .  hmmm . sounds like your author might like a bumper sticker that reads guns don not kill people , black people kill people ! honestly , his conjectures , backed up by zero evidence , zero studies and even less common sense , aren not worth the considerable time it must have taken you to type in . his assumptions look frighteningly close to those pseudo scientific studies that the white supremist assholes love . the crap that takes published statistics , twisted around in an attempt to prove the inherent criminal nature of black people . he makes valid points about demographic differences . you then resort to the kind of argument that the politically correct movement often uses to stifle any debate . nice , real nice . this author's essay contains 0 independent study upon which to base his conclusions , just some strained , disjointed statistical discourse attempting to blame seattle's murder rate on blacks . one doesn not have to produce his own data in order to point out the flaws in the methodology and conclusions of another's study . again , you resort to pc tactics . al standard disclaimer
2			horse	racing	cycling	motorcycle			 countersteering faq please post mjs also , imho , telling newbies about countersteering is , er , counter productive mjs cos it just confuses them . i rode around quite happily for 10 years mjs knowing nothing about countersteering . i cannot say i ride any differently mjs now that i know about it . i interpret this to mean that you are representative of every other motorcyclist in the world , eh mike ? rather presumptive of you ! imho in my humble opinion ! leavitt the time to learn countersteering techniques is when you are first leavitt starting to learn , before you develop any bad habits . i rode for leavitt five years before taking my first course msf erc and learning leavitt about how to countersteer . it's now eight years later , and i still leavitt have to consciously tell myself don not steer , countersteer ! old leavitt habits die hard , and bad habits even harder . mjs sorry bill , but this is complete bollocks . you learned how to countersteer mjs the first time you rode the bike , it's natural and intuitive . sorry mike , i m not going to kick over the can you not countersteer over 5mph ? stone . that one's been kicked around enough . for the sake of argument , i will concede that it's countersteering sake of argument only . mjs msf did not teach you how to countersteer , it only told you what mjs you were already doing . and there's no value in that ? i didn not say there was no value all i said was that it is very confusing to newbies . there's a big difference in 1 knowing what's happening and how to make it do it , especially in the extreme case of an emergency swerve , and 2 just letting the bike do whatever it does to make itself turn . once i knew precisely what was happening and how to make it do it abruptly and on command , my emergency avoidance abilities improved tenfold , not to mention a big improvement in my normal cornering ability . i am much more proficient knowing how to countersteer the motorcycle rather than letting the motorcycle steer itself . that is , when i remember to take cognitive command of the bike rather than letting it run itself through the corners . whereupon i return to my original comment better to learn what's happening right from the start and how to take charge of it , rather than developing the bad habit of merely going along for the ride . bill , you are kidding yourself here . firstly , motorcycles do not steer themselves only the rider can do that . secondly , it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road , the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles , and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears . are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise ? mike , i m extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total waste of time for you assuming your total training hasn not come from simply from reading rec . motorcycles . however , 90 of the motorcyclists i have discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience as overwhelmingly positive . this regardless of the amount of experience they brought into the course ranging from 10 minutes to 10 years . formal training in this country as far as i am aware does not include countersteering theory . i found out about countersteering about six years ago , from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist i didn not believe him at first when he said i steered my bike to the right to make it turn left , but i went out and analysed closely what i was doing , and realized he was right ! it's an interesting bit of knowledge , and i have had a lot of fun since then telling others about it , who were at first as sceptical as i was . but that's all it is an interesting bit of knowledge , and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it , or that you can corner faster or better as a result , is absurd formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you are going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely . but by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn . and that was my original point . mike

5			alt			 alt . atheism faq introduction to atheism please read this file before posting to alt . atheism faq , atheism archive name atheism introduction alt atheism archive name introduction last modified 5 april 1993 version 1 . 2 begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism . whilst i have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues , you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint . i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions ; some relevant books are listed in a companion article . to provide a sense of cohesion and progression , i have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt . atheism since the newsgroup was created . some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article . please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a christian viewpoint . this is because the faq files reflect questions which have actually been asked , and it is predominantly christians who proselytize on alt . atheism . so when i talk of religion , i am talking primarily about religions such as christianity , judaism and islam , which involve some sort of superhuman divine being . much of the discussion will apply to other religions , but some of it may not . what is atheism ? atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god . some atheists go further , and believe that god does not exist the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position , and the latter as strong atheism . it is important to note the difference between these two positions . weak atheism is simple scepticism ; disbelief in the existence of god . strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists . some atheists believe in the non existence of all gods ; others limit their atheism to specific gods , such as the christian god , rather than making flat out denials . but isn not disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn not exist ? definitely not . disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true . not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false ; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not . which brings us to agnosticism . what is agnosticism then ? the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in 1876 . he defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable . thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god exists . words are slippery things , and language is inexact . beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic . for example , many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism , and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism . beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning , it is very difficult to generalize about atheists . about all you can say for sure is that atheists don not believe in god . for example , it certainly isn not the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe . so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism ? there are many philosophical justifications for atheism . to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist , it's best to ask her . many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions is essentially self contradictory , and that it is logically impossible that such a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism , because they see no evidence that god exists . but isn not it impossible to prove the non existence of something ? there are many counter examples to such a statement . for example , it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers . of course , this deals with well defined objects obeying well defined rules . whether gods or universes are similarly well defined is a matter for debate . however , assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably impossible , there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non existence of god . if we assume that something does not exist , it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter example . if on the other hand we assume that something does exist , and if the thing in question is not provably impossible , showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found , to show that it isn not there . such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible . there is no such problem with largest primes , because we can prove that they don not exist therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do . even theists follow this rule most of the time ; they don not believe in unicorns , even though they can not conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere . to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested . we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he doesn not exist anywhere . so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god does not exist , since that is an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists ; instead , they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of god described by followers of various religions . so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists , it may be possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious book does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any present day religion exists . in practice , believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god exists . however , it is sufficiently different that counter arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really applicable . but what if god is essentially non detectable ? if god interacts with our universe in any way , the effects of his interaction must be measurable . hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable . if god is essentially non detectable , it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way . many atheists would argue that if god does not interact with our universe at all , it is of no importance whether he exists or not . if the bible is to be believed , god was easily detectable by the israelites . surely he should still be detectable today ? note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically verifiable , physical way . it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence , though ; otherwise , how can i distinguish him from all the other things that don not exist ? ok , you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism , but isn not it still a religious belief ? one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game . the cynical view of this game is as follows person a begins by making a contentious statement . when person b points out that it can not be true , person a gradually re defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept . he then records the statement , along with the fact that person b has agreed to it , and continues . eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact , but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it . rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent , b will tend to play along . the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isn not atheism a religious belief ? depends crucially upon what is meant by religious . religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worship . it's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition . atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power , nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense . widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such as science , politics , and watching tv . ok , so it's not a religion . but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith , like religion is ? firstly , it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in . secondly , it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience . most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible ; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt . science has a number of core assumptions . for example , it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers . these are the sort of core assumptions atheists make . if such basic ideas are called acts of faith , then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith , and the term loses its meaning . faith is more often used to refer to complete , certain belief in something . according to such a definition , atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith . of course , individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain . this is not a general tendency , however ; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists . faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof . sceptical atheism certainly doesn not fit that definition , as sceptical atheism has no beliefs . strong atheism is closer , but still doesn not really match , as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist if atheism is not religious , surely it's anti religious ? it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against , friend or enemy . the truth is not so clear cut . atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism ; in that sense , it can be said to be anti religion . however , when religious believers speak of atheists being anti religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists . this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair . atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum . most atheists take a live and let live attitude . unless questioned , they will not usually mention their atheism , except perhaps to close friends . of course , this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries . a few atheists are quite anti religious , and may even try to convert others when possible . historically , such anti religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries . to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state , just like the usa . soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished . the institution of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population . some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs , but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business for example , the government of the usa . such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate . but if you don not allow religion to have a say in the running of the state , surely that's the same as state atheism ? the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief . in particular , it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another , but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature . religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters . for example , religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms. even today , many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns . so long as they campaign concerning secular matters , and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds , most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say . what about prayer in schools ? if there's no god , why do you care if people pray ? because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers , and tend to do things that those who don not pray can not just ignore . also , christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non christians , even if they are told that they need not join in . the diversity of religious and non religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event . also , non prayers tend to have friends and family who pray . it is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time , even without other motives . you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid . what about atheists ? why aren not there any atheist charities or hospitals ? don not atheists object to the religious charities ? there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to . some atheists contribute to religious charities as well , for the sake of the practical good they do . some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis . most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn not worth shouting about in connection with charity . to them , atheism is just a simple , obvious everyday matter , and so is charity . many feel that it's somewhat cheap , not to say self righteous , to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs . to weak atheists , building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a rather strange idea ; it's rather like holding a party to say today is not my birthday . why the fuss ? atheism is rarely evangelical . you said atheism isn not anti religious . but is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing , a way of rebelling ? perhaps it is , for some . but many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them , and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists . it's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing , as a way of being different . on the other hand , many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others . on the whole , we can not conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism ; although in general , people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently . how do atheists differ from religious people ? they don not believe in god . that's all there is to it . atheists may listen to heavy metal backwards , even or they may prefer a verdi requiem , even if they know the words . they may wear hawaiian shirts , they may dress all in black , they may even wear orange robes . many buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god . some atheists even carry a copy of the bible around for arguing against , of course ! whoever you are , the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it . atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance . unexceptional ? but aren not atheists less moral than religious people ? that depends . if you define morality as obedience to god , then of course atheists are less moral as they don not obey any god . but usually when one talks of morality , one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society . humans are social animals , and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other . this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti social or immoral behaviour , purely for the purposes of self preservation . many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans . so why do they care what happens to others ? they don not know , they simply are that way . naturally , there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions . however , there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions . for example here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ came into the world to save sinners . but for that very reason , i was shown mercy so that in me . jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life . now to the king eternal , immortal , invisible , the only god , be honor and glory forever and ever . the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february 17th 1992 by jeffrey dahmer , the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee , wisconsin . it seems that for every atheist mass murderer , there is a religious mass murderer . but what of more trivial morality ? a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences . while only 4 of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again , 12 had done so after conversion . similarly , 5 had used illegal drugs before conversion , 9 after . two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation ; 5 after . freethought today , september 1991 , p . 12 . so it seems that at best , religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour . is there such a thing as atheist morality ? if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists ? then the answer is yes , as explained above . many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people . if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code ? then the answer is no. atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave . most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists , but for different reasons . atheists view morality as something created by humans , according to the way humans feel the world ought to work , rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being . then aren not atheists just theists who are denying god ? a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over 90 of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them . they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them . atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial ; they are unbelievers through choice . the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions , sometimes in very great depth . they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs . this decision may , of course , be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality . for a naturally sceptical person , the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense , and hence the only choice that person can honestly make . but don not atheists want to believe in god ? atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them . many of them have no desire to be watched over , no matter how good natured the big brother figure might be . some atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what ? should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true ? the risks of such an approach should be obvious . atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough ; there must be evidence for the belief . but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to see ! many , if not most atheists were previously religious . as has been explained above , the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god exists . many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god . of course , it is true that some atheists lack an open mind ; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed minded . comments such as of course god is there , you just aren not looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing . certainly , if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for god . if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth , debate is futile . isn not the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist ? many atheists live a purposeful life . they decide what they think gives meaning to life , and they pursue those goals . they try to make their lives count , not by wishing for eternal life , but by having an influence on other people who will live on . for example , an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform , in the hope of leaving his mark on history . it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events . however , it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning . to put it another way , not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask . some atheists believe that asking what is the meaning of life ? is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of coffee ? they believe that life has no purpose or meaning , it just is . so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger ? there are many ways of obtaining comfort ; from family , friends , or even pets . or on a less spiritual level , from food or drink or tv . that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger , but so what ? should individuals believe in things because they are comforting , or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be ? in the end , it's a decision for the individual concerned . most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable . they put truth before comfort , and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy , that's just hard luck . don not atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong ? the short answer is no , do you ? many atheists have been atheists for years . they have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god , but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive . thousands of years of religious belief haven not resulted in any good proof of the existence of god . atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future , and they stop worrying about it . so why should theists question their beliefs ? don not the same arguments apply ? no , because the beliefs being questioned are not similar . weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take ; it asserts nothing . strong atheism is a negative belief . theism is a very strong positive belief . atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believers , but to everyone else . what sort of harm ? religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind . it's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings ; think of all the time and effort spent building churches , praying , and so on . imagine how that effort could be better spent . many theists believe in miracle healing . there have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest , ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors , and dying as a result . some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds . it is arguable that the catholic church's opposition to birth control and condoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world wide . religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion . those weren not real believers . they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse . what makes a real believer ? there are so many one true religions it's hard to tell . look at christianity there are many competing groups , all convinced that they are the only true christians . sometimes they even fight and kill each other . how is an atheist supposed to decide who's a real christian and who isn not , when even the major christian churches like the catholic church and the church of england can not decide amongst themselves ? in the end , most atheists take a pragmatic view , and decide that anyone who calls himself a christian , and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his actions , should be considered a christian . maybe some of those christians are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support un christian acts it can not be much of a moral code ? if the bible is the word of god , why couldn not he have made it less easy to misinterpret ? and how do you know that your beliefs aren not a perversion of what your god intended ? if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible , then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so ? sorry , but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do so , we must call him a christian . obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned . but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist , it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs , shared by all faiths , are nonsense . that does not hold , because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue , positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones . nobody has ever proved that unicorns don not exist , but that doesn not make it unlikely that they are myths . it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default . of course , weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still . well , if atheism's so great , why are there so many theists ? unfortunately , the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is , or whether it works ; consider how many people believe in astrology , graphology , and other pseudo sciences . many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods . certainly in many primitive human societies , religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand . of course , there's more to religion than that . in the industrialized world , we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations . religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world , but nowadays it serves other purposes as well . but so many cultures have developed religions . surely that must say something ? not really . most religions are only superficially similar ; for example , it's worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense . of course , most religions are quick to denounce competing religions , so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another . what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god exists ? for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god , there is one who does not . besides , as has already been pointed out , the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it . also , it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders . a famous scientist is only human ; she may be an expert in some fields , but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight . many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise . so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing ? not entirely . it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far . the theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds , by analogy with genes . some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes , which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others . some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine , or by using peer pressure to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken . some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes . of course , in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme . religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it , any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it . even if religion is not entirely true , at least it puts across important messages . what are the fundamental messages of atheism ? there are many important ideas atheists promote . the following are just a few of them ; don not be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions . there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules . be especially sceptical of positive claims. if you want your life to have some sort of meaning , it's up to you to find it . search for what is true , even if it makes you uncomfortable . make the most of your life , as it's probably the only one you will have . it's no good relying on some external power to change you ; you must change yourself . just because something's popular doesn not mean it's good . if you must assume something , assume something it's easy to test don not believe things just because you want them to be true . and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question . thanks for taking the time to read this article . mathew begin pgp signature version 2 . 2 iqcvagubk8ajrxzxn vroblfaqfsbwp mhepy4g7ge8mo5wpsivx khyyxmerfao 7ltvtmvtu66nz6sbbpw9qkbjarby s2sz9nf5htdii0r6sseypl0r6 9bv9oke q nihqnzxe8pgvlt7tlez4eoehzjxlefrdeypvayt54yqqgb4harboehdcrte2atmp q0z4hssppau q2v5 end pgp signature for information about pgp 2 . 2 , send mail to . ÿ
4			jesus	terrorist	murder			 18 israelis murdered in march originator    i get the impression hasan realized he goofed and is now trying to drop the thread . let him . it might save some miniscule portion of his sorry face .  not really . since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself from any name calling , i started trashing any article that contains such abuses without responding to , and sometimes not even reading articles written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company ! deleted stuff well , ok . let's see what master of wisdom , mr. jonas flygare , wrote that can be wisdomely responded to  are you calling names , or giving me a title ? if the first , read your paragraph above , if not i accept the title , in order to let you get into the um , well , debate again . i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too , unless you consider yourself deserve less ! master of wisdom writes in  hasan flax hasan  in case you didnot know , palestineans were there for 18 months . and they are coming back when you agree to give palestineans their human rights .  afterall , human rights arenot negotiable .  correct me if i m wrong , but isn not the right to one's life also a human right ? or does it only apply to palestinians ?  no. it is everybody's right . however , when a killer kills , then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life's right to the society . the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life's right .  so then it's all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis ? the old eye for an eye thinking ? funny , i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that .  so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you , master of wsidom ,   if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly . sigh . that was only to confuse you ! ha ha ha hey when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate , and hence all their actions , their courts , their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories .  no , i am not neglecting that , i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here . to live , a as you so eloquently put it human right . we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later . also , you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights . first , my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men . clearly , occupation is an undeclared war ; during war , attacks against military targets are fully legitimate . secondly , surely israeli have human rights , but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories , not by further oppressing palestinean human rights . what do you expect me to tell you , master of wisdom , when i did explain my point in the post , that you responded to . the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans , which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society .  if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions , then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all ? because not all states are like israel , as oppressive , as ignorant , or as tyrant . what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue ? the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law , us law , israeli law , deleted , jonas was throwing up not for real so you can stick to the screen it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories . anyway , as for hamas , then obviously they turned to the islamic system .  and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem ?  the question is not which system would solve the me problem . why ? because any system can solve it . the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine .  i asked for which system should be used , that will preserve human rights for  all people involved . i assumed that was obvious , but i won not repeat that mistake . now that i have straightened that out , i m eagerly awaiting your reply . so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights . i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph . joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in 1940 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country . we shall not achieve our goal  of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country . the only solution is a palestine , at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs . and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries , to transfer all of them ; not one village , not one tribe , should be left . only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren . there is no other way out . davar , 29 september , 1967 courtesy of marc afifi  just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that's the english translations , if you have other information i would be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older ? i m not going to get into the question if he wrote the above , but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics . guess what . those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region . more deleted stuff exactly , you are right . i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz . we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which .  well , i can give you an answer , you master of wisdom , i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem !  i think that is fair enough .  no , that is not an answer , since i asked for a system that could solve the problem . you said any could be used , then you provided a contradiction . above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would resolve it justly . guess where that takes your logic ? to never never land . you are proving yourself as a . first you understood what i meant , but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic . too bad for you , the master of wisdom . the greatest problem of zionism is arab children . rabbi shoham .  oh , and by the way , let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer , when i try giving your posts any credit . why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were a zionists . if you believe in zionist codes and acts , well i feel sorry for you , because the same rabbi shoham had said yes , zionism is racism . if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes , then drop zionism . if you are not zionist , why are you bothered then . you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts . hasan jonas flygare ,

1			ai	windows	example			 monthly question about xcopyarea and expose events 2nd posting of the question that just doesn not seem to get answered suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics . a button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item to be drawn in the window . this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly ; instead , it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events e.g. window manager driven exposures take care of rendering the new image . using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called , the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped . the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped . what we need to do is somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item . what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior ?

4			politics	terrorist	iraq	bomb	explosive			 pr campaign against iran pbs frontline originator there have been a number of articles on the pbs frontline program about iranian bomb . here is my $ 0 . 02 on this and related subjects . one is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about iran in recent months . these include 1 attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center . despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this . they , however , have indirectly created the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter . 2 public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and outlaw state . 3 and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program . i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify . why this increased pressure on iran ? a number of factors may have been behind this . these include 1 the rise of islamic movements in north africa and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories . this movement is basically anti western and is not necessarily fueled by iran . the cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom . also , the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elected algerian islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth . a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslems. 2 possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region . 3 a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures . this has become necessary after the demise of soveit union . the recent pr campaign against iran , however , seems to be directed from israel rather than washington . there is no fundamental conflict of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion , it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations . this may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the islamic world and iran . jamshid

1			usb	windows	computer	networking	bus	linux			 buslogic 542b questions can anyone tell me if this card works with the march os 2 2 . 1 beta ?  i believe so , since the buslogic cards have proven to be very reliable in os 2 2 . 0 .  the buslogic cards have an os 2 2 . 0 driver that does work with the march 2 . 1 beta . support for the buslogic cards is not included with os 2 2 . 0 any longer . if you wish to install the beta from the cd rom , you will need to rem out the adaptec device drivers , as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic cards when os 2 attempts to use them . thanks adaptec ! so you add the buslogic drivers to the config . sys on the cd rom boot disk , and rem out the adaptec drivers . then you install the whole 1st half of the beta . and it won not work ! ibm nicely copies in the adaptec drivers once again . thanks ibm ! so . rem out the adaptec drivers once more . and reboot . if you have everything in the right order . it will work . things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation . except os 2 will try to install the adaptec scsi drivers once again at the end . so . you are off to more rem statements and more fun . the bt 542bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the adaptec cards that do not come with drivers . the dos drivers work great . this card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of i o ports and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine if you get a new card . it will also be able to support up to 8 gb drives under dos . hope this helps . dan   dan galpin

5			lgbt	gay	homosexuality	sexuality	equality			 part 1 and part 2 re homosexuality return path amail . amdahl . com ! tony i read your post , it was nothing new , i had seen much the same in other typical christian anti gay sentimental literature . gay people are and will con tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates . you may be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning african americans that have been published and used by various groups to re enforce their own bias against african americans . we usually think of the kkk in these instances , but there are many other groups . of course , the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today , but that was not always the case . fortunately african americans had whites who supported their cause and public sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around . there was even a civil war , and anti negro sentiment increased . in fact , until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them . i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination . you may think that i have been deceived or something , that is your perogative . my church , christian church disciples of christ openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society , including gays . we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples . we believe in the lord's great commandment to love , and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed , even if it is not popular to do so . i really like my church for last reason the most i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes in the commandment of love though i m hard pressed to find many who actually sho love , but not many are willing to champion the oppressed , especially within their own community . i may have lost face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs , but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of african americans . many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being nigger lovers and such . i guess i have decided the challenge is worth it . in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages , wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process , etc. funny thing is , i don not know of one case where the parents , ex wives , or even children have continued to reject their gay family member son , daughter , ex husband , father , etc. after they began to take part in some form of support group , like pflag . i m apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado , and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon from the tradition values coalition have been actively working in the christian underground to garner support within several 8 i believe states this coming november for more oppressive legisation against gays . perhaps you don not get it , and maybe you never will . many didn not get it in the middle ages and the proclaimed god's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions . the message that comes through , loud and clear , by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general , is that there is a strong dislike , even hatred for gays , whether you want to call it such or not it doesn not change the results . the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end , the final effect of posts like that of yours and mr. hudson is that you have a conditional love for gays . condition change and we will love you . this is sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an unconditional love , one that calls people just as they are . sure there are things that will naturally change , and habits like alcoholism , wife beating , etc. that need to be changed through some sort of therapy . but then there are things like left handedness , etc. that no amount of beating it out of people , is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people's expectations . in the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm , especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper spirituality . this is sad , but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change . it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality a taboo subject even today , but i firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms. it's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation , but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression . as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society . gay people are not criminals . another interesting thing happened recently . a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley here had two of it's pastors arrested for self admitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys . this had apparently been going on for some time a couple years ? but since the charges were voluntary , and the church worked closely with the police , so i imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media . how could such a thing happen when the church , itself , has an ex gay ministry ? one of my friends recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there , and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry . these are difficult times we live in , but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the christian community . the results of the passing amendment in colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over colorado called s . t . r . a . i . g . h . t . i forget the whole definition off hand , but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash and their motto is working for a fag free america with an implicit advocation for violence . this is sick , and it seems to be what you and mr. hudson , and others are embracing . we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don not measure up , and constant beratement from organizations like the christian research institute , while they do have a good purpose also , their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people . the gospel i believe is not so negative , rather it seeks ways to include people . i have several of dr. martin's books and find them quite helpful , especially concerning cults . but it seems that cri , has become a cult unto itself . why don not we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away ? whatever rich

3			science	fly			 q repelling wasps ? how do i repel wasps ? wasp this is a cross post to rec . gardens and sci . med . set the follow up line in the header , depending on what kind of advice you give , or email directly to me . i have a problem with wasps they seem to love me . last summer i couldn not spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me . i am asking for advice on how to repel wasps . this year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds . the caretaker poor fellow ! will have to take care of them , and that will give me a head start on them . last year we couldn not find any nest even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter , other wasps will most likely vie for the territory . is there anything i can grow , rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards ? never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants , i want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else . would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath ? the wasps seem to come to drink at them , and i suppose that their prey will breed in them . the black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps , because as soon as the wasp season starts , they stop coming to have their bath . even when i am not trying to win back my patio from 15 20 wasps , they seem to love me . the advice i usually get when i ask what to do about wasps , is to stand still and not wave my arms. i have got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice . i have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes , to no avail . they still love me , and come for me , even when i m in the middle of a crowd . so far only two things seem to work to kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows . nb i don not have a problem with bees or bumble bees , just wasps . patronizing advice redirected to dev null . ceci   the number of rational hypotheses that can explain any given phenomenon is infinite . phaedrus law from rm pirsig's zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance

5			jesus	christ	god	mary			 mary's assumption i hate to sound flippant , having shot off my mouth badly on the net before , but i m afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that the assumption of mary would be better phrased our assumptions about mary . in all the time i have been reading about mary on this group , i can not recall reading much about mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant , if any , scriptural foundation . i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ's parents as compellingly human persons ; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to god's working , beyond doubt . but the almalga mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures , untouched by sin or human desire . only christ himself was so truly sanctified , and even he knew temptation , albeit without submitting to it . i also don not see the necessity of saying the holy parents were some how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god's grace in being incarnated through an or dinary human being . i won not start yelling about how people are worshipping mary , etc . since folks have told me otherwise about that , but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god's incarnation in christ when we make his parents out to be sinless , sexless , deathless , otherworldly beings .   paul marxhausen . . paul you did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to offend us catholics ; hopefully i can be just as careful in my wording as you were . i also don not want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of debate anymore than it already is , but just a note or two 1 . please don not talk about jesus parents the doctrinal positions of the church an unequivocally different regarding mary and joseph . i personally have never heard of anything being attributed to st joseph other than his sainthood ; that is , no reference ever to him being sinless , assumed into heaven , immaculately conceived , etc. all these ideas apply only to mary . 2 . i would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our doctrines about mary . needless to say , that presents a significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only source of doctrine . if , however , one turns to the sacred traditions of the undivided christian church , there is no problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early generation that mary was assumed into heaven , body and soul , etc. etc. it wasn not until the reformation that these doctrines were called into question . as far as i am concerned again , my personaly feelings if it's a choice between the apostles or luther , i will choose the apostles every time , whether or not it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men have determined to be the bible . like a said , just a couple of notes . as is often said , i believe that we must agree to politely disagree . may god's peace and blessings be with you always in your search to discover his absolute truth . mike walker  univ . of illinois

3			sci	hacking	nsa	espionage	secrecy	encryption			 new encryption algorithm the history of nea nea ever since craig rowland posted his piece new encryption to sci . crypt there has been some discussion of our company , secured communications technologies , inc , and on encryption algorithm , nea . i spoke to craig at length on 4 21 93 and we covered a lot of ground . some of the information in the posting requires some clarification , and i would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci . crypt . sct is a small company based in silver spring maryland . our two main products at this time are a pc based secure communications program called secom and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the nea algorithm developed for secom . secom provides an encrypted secure communication link supports simultaneous bi directional file transfer and keyboard to screen chat . it has its own proprietary communications protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption . all though it is a packetized link , the data stream appears to be continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden . when secom was initially developed , it was implemented to use des encryption . a business decision was made to seek export approval for the product because it was perceived that the overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing opportunity . we soon found out that we would never be granted general export approval for anything using des . all though the reason for this was never explicitly stated , it seems to have something to do with secret government to government agreements which are still in effect . in any event , the decision was made to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of des . this was the reason nea new encryption algorithm was born . at this time nea is being held as a trade secret . the preliminary work of patenting it has begun , and the plan is to make it public once the patent process is complete . all though one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing secret , i think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is necessary to let people shoot at it over an extended period of time to prove its worth . in order to get export approval for secom nea , it was necessary to go through nsa and to reveal to them the details of the program and algorithm . this was done only after we had a finished product to submit . let me state unequivocally that there is no back door to the program or the algorithm . secured communications technologies is a closely held private company and nsa fbi cia nist whatever has no financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved . from a practical business standpoint , we are interested in selling chips and software hopefully in large quantities and a back door to the encryption , if found out , could destroy our credibility and our business . with the encryption algorithm approved for export , we set out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption products and systems. we were able to identify several common threads of functionality requirements . this led to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm cast in silicon and certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirements that we identified . we are strongly opposed to the clipper capstone chips . in a press release today , our president , dr. stephen bryen stated it seems as if the government has an unlimited source of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the american public . but do we not understand how the national security agency , which is not supposed to be involved in domestic spying , can fund the development of a commercial chip intended to accommodate u.s. government domestic spying activities . if they had asked me to put a back door in nea i would have told them to g f ed . can nsa break nea ? or for that matter can they break des , rsa , idea , diffy hellman , pgp , rc2 , rc4 , or whatever ? i don not know and probably never will .

2			sport	detroit	hockey	football	coaching	pittsburgh	toronto	goal			 wings will win  i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the finals which is what all the detroit sportswriters are predicting . although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm i have ever seen in hockey , i m not as impressed with his abilities as a bench coach or in general as a motivator . with the amount of talent he has on this team , he should have blown away everyone in the norris . there is not another team in the norris , maybe even in the campbell conference , that can hold a candle to detroit on paper in terms of pure talent . but , some guys have not been pulling their weight at times this year . scotty bowman , on the other hand , who has won i think , correct me if i m wrong nine 9 stanley cups , is an outstanding coach , and i think he could outcoach murray if they faced each other .  bryan murray has done very little as gm . yzerman , fedorov , cheveldae , chaisson , the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous gm . murray has made a couple of decent trades . that's about it . that would hardly rank him as the best gm . wasn not primeau , murray's first decision as gm . gerald

2			car	radar	ticket			 best radar detector ? mubashir cheema  don not buy one , that is the best way to avoid tickets , i used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over , see the thing , give me a ticket . one time my sister was driving , and had it in the glove compartment , it was broken , and she got a ticket . in 1987 , i had received 4 tickets because of it , one for my sister so a total of five .  that was five years ago , now i don not have one and have not gotten a ticket . my driving habits have not changed drastically . only two days ago i was going 77 mph on highway with 55 mph limit , cop saw me , i break a little , nothing happened i was driving a mini van , with my family in it . otherwise , i have cutlass supreme , which i do 70 most of the times on the highway .  so basically my opnion is not to get one , if you do get pulled over , the cop will hear your excuse , but if you have a radar detecter , he will not . again , this has been my experienc   just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop . but , be sure to get front and rear sensors .  you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop doesn not see it right away . valentine is the best detector by far as stated by car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from . it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up , so if you go through the same place everyday , and it always goes off there , you can glance at the number of threats the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop . it's about $ 300 and you can only get it factory direct . one problem . rob fusi

5			prophecy	religion	bible	sect	scripture	prophets	translation			 deuterocanonicals , esp . sirach on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god . to quote unger's bible dictionary on the apocrapha 1 . they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2 . they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred scripture . 3 . they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture . 4 . they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling . first , to point out the obvious while 4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue , one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the ot or for that matter the nt that doesn not , on some issues , in some way , fail one or more of the first three of these tests . second , one factor the deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition . i don not recall the exact dating of all of the books , but most if not all were written after the latest of the canonical books i.e. daniel . furthermore , while the deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in greek , they are clearly deeply hellenistic in nature . both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons . these may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books , but , as these discussions have shown , i think the one thing we can see is that there are no purely objective standards for determining canonicity . nichael ; and funcall get 'smurfy smile icon like predicate lisp sys honk

2			batting	strikeout	baseball	pitcher	goal			 young catchers mark singer said  we know that very , very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs , especially when they haven not even played aaa ball . yes . but this is irrelevant . you are talking about averages , when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on . i might as well say we know that very , very few people are more than 7 feet tall , so chances are that manute bol is really only 6 foot 4 . no. maybe i need to improve my writing skills . lopez , who is very ordinary defensively , is not likely to hit so well at age 22 having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in 1993 . why isn not lopez likely to hit that well ? he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such ; he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did . by a lot . as for rushing . if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i don not believe there is , then wouldn not you rather waste lopez's 22 year old good season than his 23 year old very good season or his 24 year old excellent season ? the sooner you get him acclimated , the more of his prime you get to use . lopez was hitting . 588 over 17 ab when he was cut from spring training . what does he have to do to earn a chance ? maybe not a full time job , but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth ?  gee . i don not know . 17 abs sounds pretty good to me ! about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at aaa . talk about me as a gm . the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample , but rather that he hadn not done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real , or to send him down until he gets warmed up . ok . most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 most players are never ready for the bigs . what does this have to do with javy lopez ? most players benefit , rather than being stagnant or hurt , by playing at aaa . see above . most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs . those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year . but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds . most players aren not that good , so they probably won not be that good this year either . now . the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games , to work with the pitchers , to throw out runners . and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble . not superstars mind you , but solid , experienced veterans . not superstars , not stars , not even good players . maybe average , if we are being charitable . the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield , an excellent platoon at first , a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops . ummm . justice is a very fine hitter . pendleton might have another big year in his bat , but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell . gant is a big question mark . the bream hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on who's in . blauser is a very valuable bat . for a shortstop . the center field platoon will probably hit . 300 . however good lopez bat might be given the above it won not be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability . wanna bet ? the difference between lopez's bat and olson berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season . given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play , i will take the latter every time . the kid will improve playing at aaa , just like keith mitchell did ? i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out . my goodness . do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential ? that was me , and you so far your only counter proposal is that they really don not understand how good lopez is , or overvalue experience , or some combination of the two . i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization . are they idiots who have built this ballclub ? well argued but inflammatory reply deleted .  david m . tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens ; only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose's dy cummings nobody , not even tim raines , has such soft hands

5			woman	satan	religion	evil	islam	gender	demon	god			 the problem of satan used to be islamic authority over women of course , bobby then states that satan has no free will , that he does as god wants him to . this brings up a host of paradoxes is god therefore evil ; do i have free will or is god directing me also ; if god is evil , which part of his infinite self is good and which is evil ; etc . i would like for once a solid answer , not a run about . i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one i simply don not agree with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force . the belief to which i ascribe is that evil is not a creation ; rather , it is the absence of good . this fits with all the logic about things having dual use e.g . a knife can be used to sculpt and it can be used to kill . like entropy , evil is seen in this view as neither force nor entity . satan is , therefore , metaphorical . in fact , there are several verses of the holy qur an which appear to support this view and several traditions as well .  for example , there is a tradition that food should never be left open on a shelf or table overnight , lest satan enter it . it appears that this is a reference to as yet undiscovered germs ; thus , the evil effect of spoiled food is described as satan . but there are many examples of satan personified . which am i to believe ? and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the holy qur an , the bible , etc. there have been times in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical descriptions of heaven , hell , and satan were taken quite literally and that worked for the time . as i mentioned in the tradition cited above , for example , it was sufficient in the absence of a theory about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic . which begs the question if satan in this case is metaphorical , how can you be certain allah is not the same way ? the bottom line here , however , is that describing a spiritual plane in human language is something like describing color to a person who has been blind from birth . you may want to read the book flatland if you haven not already or the dragon's egg . the first is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con cept . some deleted for space saving when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers , then such conventions as metaphor , allegory , and the like come to be necessary . the unseen is described in terms which have reference and meaning for the reader listener . but , like all models , a compro mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness of meaning , equivalence of perception , and the like are all crippled . but what else can you do ? this is why i asked the above . how would you then know god exists as a spirit or being rather than just being metaphorical ? i mean , it's okay to say well , satan is just metaphorical , but then you have to justify this belief and justify that god is not some metaphor for something else . i say this because there are many , many instances of satan described as a being such as the tormentor in the old testament book of job , or the temptor in the new testament gospels . in the same way , god too is described as a being or spirit . how am i to know one is metaphorical and not the other . further , belief in god isn not a bar to evil . let's consider the case of satanists even if satan were metaphorical , the satanist would have to believe in god to justify this belief . again , we have a case where someone does believe in god , but by religious standards , they are evil . if bobby does see this , let him address this question also . deleted some more on metaphor obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible , but i m not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve into religious interpretation further . however , if anyone wishes to discuss this , i m certainly willing either off line email or on line posting . stephen atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr . and all that jazz .

4			politics	government	ethic			 limiting govt was re employment thanks for the offer news software vax vms vnews 1 . 4 b1  i couldn not disagree with you more strongly . it sounds good , but in practice it too often becomes tyranny , because there are too often conflicting ideas of what constitutes improving the human condition . far better to let people and their organizations pursue whatever goals they think best , and let the human condition be improved by those who are willing to do so without coercion .  there will always be conflicting ideas on what constitutes improving the human condition , that's humanity . you seem to believe that libertarianism will improve the human condition by lifting all constraints , and that people will have a better chance of improving themselves in that environment .  let me try to put it another way . libertarians believe that an unconstrained environment provides the best chance of solving any problem because it maximizes creativity . however , there is never any guarantee that a really good solution will ever be found to any particular problem . utopia is not an option . utopia is a myth although we can do a lot better than what we have today . but i think that you must pitch libertarianism as a progressive agenda ie you can do better under our style of system . i admire a lot of what the libertarians stand for , but you guys are some of the worst salesmen i have ever seen . and when it comes to politics , you need salesmen whether you want them or not .  what we need are more people who agree with us , know something about marketin , and are willing to both do that marketing and teach others how to . are you in ? i m flattered by your invitation , but i m afraid you have the wrong person . although i completely agree with your civil liberties agenda , i m not in support of your economic agenda . what i do like about the libertarian party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the past i encourage you guys to continue your crusade , but i m afraid i can not ride along .  ian sutherland   nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has garrett johnson come . tussman  june  nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has garrett johnson come . tussman the probability of someone watching you is proportional to the stupidity of your action . unknown

3			tourism	star	america	marketing	business	space	advertising			 no. re space marketing would be wonderfull . if this idea goes through , it's the thin end of the wedge . soon companies will be doing larger , and more permanant , billboards in the sky . i wouldn not want a world a few decades from now when the sky looks like las vegas . that would really make me sad . think for a moment about the technology required to do that . by the time they could make the earth's sky look like las vegas , the people could afford to go backpacking on the moon . round trip costs for 500 kg to the moon would be about the same as 5000 kg in a low earth advertising orbit very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard , therefore . if such ads were to become common place , that would have to be a very low price . the night sky on a lunar backpacking trip would still be very pristine . there's always been a problem of having to get away from civilization before you can really find natural scenery . 100 years ago , this usually didn not take a trip of over 5 miles . today , most people would have to go 100 miles or more . if we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit , that essentially means that no place on earth is still wild . while that may or may not be a good thing , the orbital billboards aren not the problem they are just a symptom of growing , densely populated civilization . banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky , because by the time such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights , where you can see the stars . coca cola company will want to paint the moon red and white . well , if not this moon , then a moon of jupiter .  an ad on a moon of jupiter would be rather pointless , since you need a telescope to see them . however , i would love to see them get all the publicity they could from underwritting the coca cola io orbital mapping probe . . microscum will want to name a galaxy microscum galaxy . they already can , to some extent the iau allows names derived from sponsors or patrons of scientific research . if microscum donates money to a university astronomy program , one of the galactic astronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after them .  frank crary cu boulder

2			violence	driving	car	safety	murder			 warning . please read . this happened about a year ago on the washington dc beltway . snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass . four or five cars were hit . there were several serious injuries , and sadly a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck in the head by one of the larger rocks . i don not recall if she made it , but i think she was comatose for a month or so and doctors weren not holding out hope that she would live .  what the hell is happening to this great country of ours ? i can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such , but 20 pound rocks ? has our society really stooped this low ?  erik velapold  society , as we have known it , it coming apart at the seams ! the basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is no big deal . kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on tv , we can abort children on demand , and kill the sick and old at will . so why be surprised when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people . they don not care because the message they hear is life is cheap !  at well people fortunatly or unfortunatly , only the us is experiencing the devaluation of human life among developed nations . i am an american but i was raised in europe , where the worst thing that can happen to somebody is get his car broken into , or have his pocket picked by slaves or russian refugees . of cource there will be some nutcases , but thats extremely rare . i.e. in greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during the night without even worrying . in germany , you can walk the sidewalks at 4 . 00 am and not even look behind your back , at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a sparkling cleen . whoever of you have been there you know what i am saying . i dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism we might get somewhere . of course these postings sould be in soc . culture . us but if we reduce crime here it will mean less car insurance rates , thus we could spend more money on modifing our cars . now my posting is rec . autos . tech revelant . vlasis theodore  software engineer idb mobile communications . sig under development .

3			genetics	infection	bacteria	science	fungi	disease			 quack quack was re candida yeast bloom , fact or fiction i don not know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist no scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question . the burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence of this syndrome . to date , these claims are unsubstantiated by any available data . hopefully , as a scientist , you would take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based upon their data . beasties with present methods even if they were there . noring and the fellow from oklahoma sorry , forgot your name have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences namely , that when people with certain conditions are given anti fungals , many of them appear to get better . gee , i have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself , my friends , and my family , but in the practice of medicine i expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than aunt susie's brother in law . anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis , but rarely proves anything in a positive sense . and unlike mathematics , boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues , and so evidence of exceptions does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease . so , if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for example , controlled double blind studies showing that the anti fungals don not do any better than sugar water then let's hear it . if you don not , then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side , and abject disbelief on the other . in which case , please , there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative . i would characterize it not as abject disbelief but rather scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions . it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double blind study of antifungals or else , forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test , just carry it out themselves ! and also , whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis . i have no problem with such an approach ; but this is not what is happening in the not renches of this diagnosis . bob schmieg

3			genetics	biotechnology	bacteria	science	cancer	dr	autism			 burzynski's antineoplastons i have recently listened to a tape by dr. stanislaw burzynski , in which he claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti cancer properties that he names antineoplastons . burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the united states , despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trials . what is the generally accepted opinion of dr. burzynski's research ? he paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment , but i have no basis from which to judge his claims. two weeks ago , however , i read that the nih's department of alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynski's work . their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldn not investigate a treatment that didn not seem promising . any opinions on burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be appreciated .  joshua schwimmer
2			politics	morris			 jack morris  the only really valid retort to valentine is weren not the red sox trying to get morris too ? oh , sure , they said viola was their first choice afterwards , but what should we have expected they would say ? lou wanted morris all along . the idiot . giving the man $ 40 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the safety off . the only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away . and don not tell me boston will win this year . they won not even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th .  if this is true , it won not be for lack of contribution by viola , so who cares ? i don not see why people expect boston to finish sixth . the bottom four teams last year were essentially tied . boston , in seventh place , had 73 wins . the yankees and indians , tied for fourth place , had 76 wins . now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than the indians or tigers . basically , the red sox are stronger this year at 1b , dh , ss , lf , and rf . they have healthier starting pitchers so far , at least and better relievers . i see no reason why they shouldn not win 85 games . meanwhile , the indians are in shambles and the tigers still have no pitching . they will win some 20 3 blowouts , but they will lose an awful lot of 7 5 games too . maybe the sox will play poorly , win 78 games , and finish fifth . but i think third or fourth place is more likely . cheers , valentine

5			homosexual	lgbt	homosexuality	sex	gay	sexuality	controversy			 homosexual issues in christianity bryan whitsell sent in a list of verses which he felt condemn homosexuality . michael siemon wrote in response that some of these verses are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations and that others simply do not address the issues . i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues , however , a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality .  . do not be deceived ; neither fornicators , nor idolators , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor homosexuals , nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers , shall inherit the kingdom of god . and such were some of you . i cor . 6 9 11 .  would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god ? how does this apply to homosexuals ? i understand fornication to be sex outside of marriage . is this an accurate definition ? is there any such thing as same sex marriage in the bible ? my understanding has always been that the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife . i am , however , willing to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary . remainder of my post deleted the moderator then made some comments i would like to address there's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote . both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals , but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute . that doesn not meant that i think all the biblical evidence vanishes , but the nature of the evidence is such that you can not just quote one verse and solve things . if you are referring to the terms effeminate and homosexuals in the above passage , i agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged . however , i was simply commenting on the charge that it is an incredibly perverse interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality . such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that paul intended to condemn homosexuality ; however , i think i can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse . therefore i do not believe it is incredibly perverse to read it in this way . i think your argument from fornication is circular . why is homosexuality wrong ? because it's fornication . why is it fornication ? because they are not married . why aren not they married ? because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony . why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony ? because homosexuality is wrong . in order to break the circle there's got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong .  clh actually , i wasn not thinking of the church at all . after all , a couple doesn not have to be married by a minister . a secular justice of the peace could do the job , and the two people would be married . my point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage , but where in the bible would one get a christian marriage between two people of the same sex ? and if you do see a biblical basis for same sex marriages , how willing would gay christians be to save themselves for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship ? please note that i am not trying to imply that gay christians would not be willing to be so monogamous , i am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject . i have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual , yet i tend to doubt that gays who want to be christian would advocate such a position . so what is the gay view ? mark yes , i agree that a reasonable person might conclude that paul is condemning homosexuality . i was responding to certain details of your posting . that doesn not mean i agree with michael in all respects . clh

2			pirate	lacrosse	politics	hockey	football	baseball	soccer			 way to go ferraro ! news software vax vms vnews 1 . 41 the isles picked one hell of a time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods . the caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from tabaracci . the isles power play philosophy continues to be dump and chase which , except for boardaholics like flatley , doesn not work against the caps . i hope al realizes this ! they have too many talented finesse players , so why not carry the puck in and set up ? if last night's game is any omen , the isles could be on their way to that ole championship form ; coming from behind late in a game . my advice to the caps is to pounce on those healy rebounds . flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of dale hunter . ray ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us islander fans remember from an italian from the past ; john tonelli ! it was tonelli who won a similar game against the pens in game 5 on the 82 playoffs . the isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into ot tied at 3 . in ot , tonelli scored the game winner to send the isles to the next round . the isles have lacked this tenacity for years , but perhaps its back ! it was good to see the coliseum packed just like the ole days ! good luck to the isles the rest of the way ! john scialdone and the home of the brave jerry garcia , bob weir , vince welnick april 12 , 1993 opening day , candlestick park
3			electronics	amplifier	audio	switching			 suggestions on audio relays ? i built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch audio . i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched . i was doing my question is is there a good relay relay circuit that i can use for switching  are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre amp a novel circuit i used to build was a primitive optical isolator . it consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp , all packaged in a tube . when the lamp is off the cell is high resistance . turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers i use an h11f1 fet optoisolater to switch microphone level signals . there is no click , since i put a . 1uf cap across the led . distortion measurement are very low with mic level , and they went up to 0 . 03 at a 14 db line level . all i did was put the fet in series with one leg of the balanced line . no hums , pops , just audio jumping out of silence . the fet runs about 100 million ohms with the led dark and drops to 150 200 ohms with it on . hey , it works , and works well . galen watts , kf0yj

3			computer	electricity			 telephone on hook off hok ok circuit just a thought of mine here since an on hook line is aprox 48 50v , and off hook it usually drops below 1 how about an led in series with a zener say around 30v . on hook led on off hook led off . would this work ? if anyone tries tried it , please let me know .  aye , there's the rub if you draw enough current to light an led , the equipment at the phone company will think you have gone off hook . in the on hook state you are not supposed to draw current .  which means you should just use your digital voltmeter . you can use an old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think there's something wrong with the cable .   look guys , what's the problem here ? if you want a light that goes on when the phone is off hook , all you need it to run it in series with the line , as i mentioned in my previous post if you want a light that goes on when the phone is on hook , all you need is a voltage threshold detector .  if you are going to do the series diode thing which is the easiest , just make sure that the led can take the current i can not recall it off hand , but it's something like 100ma or more ? careful now folks . also consider the 90vac 20hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring ! even with a simple zener and led setup , you might end up with some carbon real quick . whatever scheme you use , make sure you have got at least 200v rated components on the frontend . also remember that , if i m not mistaken , the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit . any current you draw from the 48v or so gets dropped across that 600ohms. that's fine until you are down to roughly 12v , when ma bell considers it to be off hook . but dropping it that far down is probably a big no no. the easiest implementation to accomplish the above ? tip rectifier resistor diode v zener resistor   v led   ring this is only a suggestion . go ahead and blow holes in it , but you get the idea . choose a high efficiency led so you don not need much current to get it to light up . choose values for the other components as required . aaron
1			microsoft	windows	computer	linux	chicago			 re win nt what is it ?  two part question  1 what is windows nt a are al windows os ?  2 this past weekend , a local hacker radio show metioned a new product from microsoft called chicago if i recall . anyone know what this is ?  that is it  thanks a heap .  alan  windows nt is a giant windows operating system . unline win3 . 1 , it does not run on top of dos . it is its own os , with billy gates assures us true multi tasking multithreading , meets dod security specs , will run win3 . 1 programs as well as dos programs , has multi processor support , and is primarily a server program . it's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users . it also runs os 2 character based apps and posix apps . the dos , 16bit and 32 bit windows apps run in a windows 32 bit subsystem . if you consider the fact that nt has the lanman redirectors , built in support for tcp ip built in support for netbeui comes with tcp utils like ping and an ftp client , etc applications like schedule and a 32 bit version of msmail the storage argument isnt an issue . speaking of overhead , it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of ram . it iwll run with 12 , but that's like running os 2 2 . 0 with 4 megs . and that's just to run it . also , i have heard that the system files take up 30 50 megs , and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig ! the skd is distributed on cd rom .  i ran it on a 486 with 8mram and it did a ton of disk swapping , with a 19m virtual memory paging file . it functioned but it crawled . this was the oct build i upgraded the machine to 16m and the performance is good , at that point i installed the march build . consider they are probably still working on the feature set , and havent done a lot of fine tuning to the code yet . chicogo is what i want to use . it is , like nt , a true os with thrue multitasking and multithreading , but has much smaller hardware requirements , and does not meet dod security specs but that's okay since it will probably be more of a client os . there are a few otehr differences , but those are the main ones . there was an article about chicogo in pc week last august the chicogo and nt development groups at micro $ oft are in intense competition , so it is said . however , i think a different relationship will arise nt will be the server n etowrk t echonology , chicogo will be the client machine . it is entirely possible for different os's to work together , partly because chicogo is just a small nt think of it that way , anyway . novell netware creates an os on the server that is truly not dos , so don not scorn the concept . anyway , don not expect it soon . windows 4 and dos 7 are supposed to be released next year read see it in 95 , so i expect that chicogo won not be out til 96 . i have little info on chicago so i cant make a comparison . is it in beta ? is there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison ? just my $ 0 . 02 aln

4			congress	election	politics	america	democracy	clinton			 clinton remarks to law enforcement leaders 675 mass . ave . cambridge , ma 02139 , usa 1 617 876 3296  the white house office of the press secretary  for immediate release april 15 , 1993  remarks by the president to law enforcement organizations   the rose garden 2 52 pm edt the president good afternoon . ladies and gentlemen , two months ago i presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people , their jobs and their economic future . the federal budget plan passed congress in record time , and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country .  then , the short term jobs plan i presented to congress , which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the house of representatives two weeks ago . it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate .  all of these members of congress know it's time to get the economy moving again , to get job growth going again , to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity . unfortunately , a minority of the members of the united states senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill .  when congress returns , i ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake . the issue is not politics , it's people . sixteen million of them are looking for full time jobs and can not find them . these men and women don not care about who's up or down in washington . they care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment , about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children , about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck .  they are asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward i am prepared to do that . and i have been working with the senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan . i m willing to compromise , so long as we keep the focus on jobs , keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs .  our opponents have been asking for a smaller package . today i ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the american people .  but even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller , i believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of americans , and one in particular , and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime .  so i will ask , even in this reduced package , for an additional $ 200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession . together , with a matching effort by local governments , this could put as many as 10 , 000 police officers back on the job , and back on the beat in communities all across our nation .  at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime , when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes , rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments america can make . and i ask both houses of congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind .  i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs . make no mistake about it i will fight for these priorities as hard as i ever have . i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs , their future and for fundamental change .  i want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that i had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers . they came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package . and i want them to be free to talk about that . they came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer , to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future .  i say what i say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these communities . i have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate , but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they are hired to protect . it reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time .  these are the kinds of things that we are trying to do . i promised in my campaign that i would do everything i could to put another 100 , 000 police officers on the street over the next four years . this makes a good downpayment on that . this keeps in mind the core of the jobs package . and this will help us to move forward  so i ask the people in the senate who have blocked the jobs bill , let's work together . i can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets . i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people . i have done my part now to end the gridlock ; i ask you to do yours .  i want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the american people beginning with janet reno , the distinguished attorney general .     q mr. president , can you tell us do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue ?  the president not at all . i think it should have they wouldn not have any relationship one to the other . first of all , i made absolutely no decision on that . you should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers , particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy . but i have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax .  q do you personally believe that the american public is ready to pay for to have another tax to pay for health care ? i mean , apart from what business and labor leaders have said  the president i m not going to speculate on that . i will say this the real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost i mean , that is everyone knows that if you do what we are proposing to do , if you streamline the insurance system , if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over utilize or over provide certain services , if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn not now , every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system .  the real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security . i have no idea . the polls say that , but i don not know . all i know is the polls that i see in the press that many of you have commissioned , they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system .  but i don not think that has anything to do with this stimulus , and it certainly shouldn not have . people want a job first and foremost they want that more than anything else .  q now that you have announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package , can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable ? i assume summer jobs is one .  the president i want the summer jobs ; i want the highway program and i want the police program . i still intend let me say this i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill , which did not pass the congress last year . this is a supplement to that , not a substitute for it in any way . but i think we need to do that .  i think we need the ryan white funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with aids . and there are several other things that i think should be done . we have to do the agriculture department meat inspectors ; the safety of the public depends on that .  there are a number of other things that i don not i don not think any of it should be cut , but i have given senator mitchell and senator byrd i talked to them . and senator dole called me yesterday to discuss this , and i told him that i would call him back . i called him back last night in new hampshire and we discussed this . and i basically asked them to talk today , and said that i would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord  so i don not want to be any more specific than i have been already , and let's see if they can talk it out .  q when you talked to senator dole and senator mitchell did you tell them about your increase also , that $ 200 million , that you want that as part of the package ?  the president i did i told senator i left word for senator mitchell last night about it . when i talked to senator dole i don not remember for sure i do not believe i mentioned it . but i did tell him that i was prepared to reduce the package and i wanted to break the gridlock , and i told him that i was working on a reformulation of it so that in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that i thought the american people wanted us to address . and this is certainly consistent with that .  thank you . end3 12 pm edt

's postings , i find someone who is honestly seeking the truth . when i read your response here , i see condescension . when you reply to a post , reply to the post you quote . this statement undermines any good points you might have had it was enough to make me stop reading . sometimes i do come across condesending , and i am sorry i come across that way at times . thank you for the reproach , i really do appreciate it . i will try to get better . rob , at the same time , i have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke . brian k . so far , only responds to the latter . and i am glad he responds at all . in both cases of approach , my intention is to be loving . i am making no excuse for myself if i am coming across condesending . i apologize for that . rob , sometimes brian k . comes across as honest i know this . but brian k . vasillates back and forth . one post looks honest ; the next is an excuse . now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less . i think brian kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses . i just want brian k . to be honest with himself . if he really wants to know , he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my god . i wish brian would read the bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock god . from my perspective rob , when i look at brian kendig , i see a man standing out in the middle of a highway . off into the distance i see a mack truck heading right for him , but brian k . is faced away from the oncoming truck . he doesn not see it . here's is how i see the dialog me brian k , please step aside before you get run over . bk there is no truck . me turn around at look . bk no. me look ! you will be healthier if you do take a look at the oncoming truck . bk no. explain to me why trucks exist me turn around or you will run over . bk no. i won not because i like hiking and tomorrow is tuesday . me you blind fool ! why do you choose ignorance ? you have nothing to lose if you look . but if do not look , you will certainly lose your life . i do not want to see you squashed all over the road . bk it is my life to lose . i rather not look . besides , a truck running over me will not harm me . and by the way , i really have an open mind . so is my motivation to belittle brian , or to love brian the best i know how ? i do not wish to single brian kendig out . because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category . perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives . i have . i can now see the truck behind brian . my hope is that brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him . my hope is that brian will want to step out of the way . my fear , though , is that brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway , where he will certainly get run over . but if he so chooses , he so chooses , and there is nothing i can do beyond that to change his mind . for it is his choice . but at this very moment , brian hasn not gotten even that far . he is still at the point where he does not want to look . sure he moves his eyeball to appease me , but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture . so far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance . thank you again rob for your reproach . i really do appreciate it . my wife tells me the same thing at times . i will try to do better .

5			satan	jesus	religion	christianity	theology	christian	church	god			 satanic tounges we chose to believe whetever we want , but we are not allowed to define our own christianity . we see in parts . if you see something that i do not see , or vice versa , it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief !  it is important if christianity is being damaged by it . if people who speak in tongues make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the holy spirit , when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises , it damages all christians , since many who are not christians do not distinguish between the various sects . the more modest claim for tongues that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which words fail you is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice . i agree with the point that charismatic practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for god ; one of the things jesus warned us about . matthew huntbach

3			software	storage	networking	recovery	computer	maintenance			 how to the disks copy protected . the program is definitely backupable , if restored to the same machine depends on the programmer . don not use a disk drive characteristic ! if the user did an upgrade to the machine , he she should reinstall all programs any way . no document look up , no disk wear and tear ! this is not a good idea . i upgraded my motherboard last fall . i would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because i changed motherboards . any info in the bios is too volatile to use as a checksum . are you going to require that a user re install all their software if they add 4mb of ram to their computer ? i did that a couple of weeks ago . it's in the bios , and if software had told me this isn not the machine you installed me on i would never have used that software again . really bad idea . i did not say that the originals would allow only one install . the user's conscience should do that . this is silly . it's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk , and then give them that . your scheme isn not going to stop anyone . you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz ? two ! yes , two ! and don not ask me which ones they are . do you know any assembly language at all ? all anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz , and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it . not that difficult , really ! and there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing . using pklite or some similar utility would help , but only if the resulting compressed . exe were tagged as uncompressable . what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup registered to xxxxx address , city , state zip and disables the above . this is by far the best idea you presented in your post making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates . but , the determined ones are just going to answer joe blow to the question of what's your name so this won not stop them in the long run . pirates are always going to win this fight . they simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme .  steve madsen ask me about linux , the free 386 unix !

5			science	physic	radiation	alien			 americans and evolution , now with free ockham's razor inside sorry about the delay in responding , due to conference paper deadline panic . alarming amounts of agreement deleted i made my statement about ockums razor from my experiences in physics . thanks for info in baysian statistics very interesting and i didn not know it before . i follow your proof , but i have one questions . we have two hypotheses h and hg the latter is more complicated , which by definition means p h p hg . that complicated isn not in fact where p h p hg comes from ; it's more the other way around . it's from p h p hg p hg where g is the complement of g and by axiom , p anything 0 , so p hg 0 , so p h p hg . in a sense , hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g , so i may be splitting hairs , but what i m trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is , p h p hg holds , with equality if and only if p hg 0 . as you point out , it's a very simple matter to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x , and thus h is to be preferd to hg . now to say that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say p x h p x hg . can you elaborate some on this . well , p x a p x b means that x is as likely to be observed if a is operative as it is if b is operative . this implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that a and b are operative ; the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probabilities p a and p b p x a p x b p a x k p a , and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x . so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesn not give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative . in the particular case where a h and b hg , however , we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by p h p hg , although we don not know the actual values , and it's this which allows us to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg . also , in the real world it isn not as clear cut and dry it seems to me . we can not always determine whether the equality p x h p x hg is true . that's certainly true , but the particular point here was whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component , which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word . now it seems to me , as i have said , that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model , but rather less well if one proposes a divine component in addition , since i would expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs . thus my personal feeling is that p x hg isn not even equal to p x h in this case , but is smaller h is memetic transmission , g is divine component , x is the variance among beliefs . but i happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression . btw , my beef with your baysian argument was not a mathematical one i checked most of your work and didn not find an error and you seem very careful so there probably isn not a math mistake . i think the mistake is philosophical . but just to make sure i understand you , can please rephrase it in non technical terms ? i think this is a reasonable request i always try to look for ways of explaining physics to non physicist i m not a baysian statistician nor any type of statistician , so this would be very helpful . not that i m a statistician as such either , but the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the read my observations to date . however , theism of the type with which i am concerned also suggests that , for instance , prayer may be answered , people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god s may generally intervene in measurable ways . this means that these regions of the space of possible observations , which i loosely termed appearances of god s , have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic . since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space , the probability which theism expends on making appearances of god s possible must come from somewhere else i.e. other possible observations . all else being equal , this means that an observation which isn not an appearance of god s must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism . the bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase , with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis . sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque , but it's rather difficult to put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities , and particularly that the total area under them is always unity . an analogy may or may not be helpful . say that hypothesis a is the coin is fair , and that b is the coin is unfair two headed . i have used a and b to avoid confusion with h heads and t tails . then p h a 0 . 5 total 1 p t a 0 . 5 p h b 1 total 1 p t b 0 the observations are a string of heads , with no tails . this is compatible with both a fair coin a and a two headed coin b . however , the probability expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails even though they don not actually appear must come from somewhere else , since the total must be unity , and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads . say our running estimates at time n 1 are e n 1 a and e n 1 b . the observation x n at time n is another head , x n h . the estimates are modified according to p h a e n a e n 1 a e n 1 a m p h and p h b e n b e n 1 b e n 1 b 2m p h now we don not know p h , the actual prior probability of a head , but the multiplier for e a is half that for e b . this is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed . thus whatever the initial values of the estimates , after n heads , we have n e n a m e 0 a and n e n b 2m e 0 b , and since e k a e k b 1 at any time k , you can show that 0 . 5 m 1 and thus 1 2m 2 . hence the estimate for the fair coin hypothesis a must decrease at each trial and that for the two headed coin hypothesis b must increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads . the loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism , and between fair coin and theism , with observations consistent with both . a tail , which would falsify unfair coin , is analogous to an appearance of god s , which would falsify atheism . i am not claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities , just that the principle is the same . constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them  is at all possible under the respective theisms , constantly increases  the notional estimated probability that they don not exist , it's important to draw a distinction between theism that could be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can not . given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible , it doesn not make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary view . quite so , but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg , in terms of our ockham's razor discussion , and i would bin it on those grounds . so it depends upon your conception of this god . if it's a conception like zeus , who happened to come down to earth to play quite frequently , then i agree with you lack of evidence for this conception of god is evidence that it does not exist but if your conception of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions see below on falsifiable predictions , then i disagree lack of evidence does not support a disbelief . the hypotheses don not have to be falsifiable , and indeed in my model , the theism isn not falsifiable . . i used the phrase should obverse . given any specific x theism does not make the prediction p x ht 0 . that's why i used the word should theism makes no predictions about any specific event . i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such and such happens , or i believe god will do such and such . but for any given x i can never , a priori , say p x ht 0 . i can not even say this for the set of all x or some x . this is what don not like about your use of probability . we also have no way of assigning these probabilities i hold science to positivistic criteria if someone cannot tell me how to measure , even in principle , p x h , then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h . such is the case when h ht theistic and ha atheistic . for example , p x ha p x & ha p ha . what is p ha ? ! how do i measure it ? you don not have to . we don not need , in the above analogy , to know any prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair coin hypothesis is less than unity , and that the corresponding multiplier for the two headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity . you don not need to know the initial values of the running estimates either . it's clear that after a large number of observations , p fair coin approaches zero and p two headed coin approaches unity . all you need to know is whether p x ha is larger than p x ht for observed x , and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered possible not necessary under ht which are not possible under ha , and all else is equal . baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations . but what if the hypothesis isn not amenable to observation ? and even for statements that are amenable to observation , some observations are not relevant a sequence of observations must be chosen with care . i m curious to know what types of observations x 1 , x 2 , you have in mind concerning theism and atheism . any observations you like ; it really doesn not matter , nor affect the reasoning , provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of god s . examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer , or of the veracity of revelation . but any statement about p x h for general x still counts as a prediction of h . if the theism in question , ht , says that prayer may be answered , or that miracles may happen see my interpretation , quoted again above , of what god exists means , then this is a prediction , p x ht 0 for such x . it's what distinguishes it from the atheist hypothesis ha , which predicts that this stuff does not happen , p x ha 0 for such x . theism does not make the claim that p x ht 0 for such x . or i should say that my theism doesn not . maybe i was too quick to say we had a common language . you said that by the existence of god you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents . i agreed with this . however , i must be careful here . i believe this i m not making any claims. maybe i should have changed does to can there is an important shift of emphasis . but any way , since i only have a belief , i cannot conclude p x ht 0 for such x . ok , we will downgrade does interact to may interact , which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced . i don not think my theism makes predictions . maybe i m not understanding what you mean by prediction could you explain what you mean by this word ? i will explain , but bear in mind that this isn not central ; all i require of a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of god s will never happen , as does atheism . before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn not make this prediction either , the difference is that qm and atheism do not form a partition . predictions include such statements as prayer is efficacious implying if you do the stats , you will find that prayer is efficacious , or prayer is not efficacious , or verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled . i don not think we have any problems of misunderstanding here . persistent observation of this stuff not happening , consistent with ht though it may be , is more consistent with ha , as explained in the bayesian stats post  even if ht god exists is unfalsifiable , that's no problem for my argument , other than that you have to let the number of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically . btw , i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of observations as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid . we , as existing humans , can never make an infinite number of measurments and any conclusion that reilies on this i don not accept as valid . that's fine ; i don not claim that theism is false , merely that the finite number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is , and that as i continue to observe , the suggestion looks better and better . renormalization stuff deleted in the bayesian stats post , i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable in a finite number of observations . here's the relevant quote  $ the important assumption is that there are some observations which $ are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist $ hypothesis , and thus would falsify atheism ; these are what i called $ appearances of god s , but this need not be taken too literally . any $ observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods $ exist will count . all other observations are assumed to be compatible $ with both hypotheses . this leaves theism as unfalsifiable , and atheism $ as falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearances of $ god s . here is my problem with this . for something to be falsifiable it must make the prediction that x should not be seen . if x is seen then the hypothesis has been falsified . now , atheism is a word in oposition to something theism . a theism aserts a belief and an atheism aserts a disbelief . so there are certain atheisms that are certainly falsifiable just as there are certain theisms that are falsifable e.g. if my theism asserts the world is only 6 , 000 years old and that god does not decieve then this has been falsified . however , the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also unfalsifiable . i could be wrong on this statment . contd i think you are ; an appearance of god s is sufficient to falsify atheism , whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable . i will think more about it . until then , here is a general question . suppse x were unfalsifiable . is not x also unfalsifiable ? no by way of a counterexample , let x the coin is fair , or more accurately so that not x makes sense the two sides of the coin are different . this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin ; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin , and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify x in the limit . its converse is falsifiable , and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared . this is partly what's wrong with you baysian argument which requires observations x 1 . x n to be made . there are simply no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the statement god exists . now , by use of your symmetry argument , i can understand why someone would say since the statement god does not exist  makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it . but none the less this would be founded on a type of faith or if you don not like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable evidence instead . i will assume you meant god exists up there at the highlight . but by our agreed definition of exists , the statement makes predictions as i said above , although it isn not falsifiable in a finite number of observations . actually , i mean god does not exist makes no predictions . oops . sorry . mea culpa . the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are refering to . but i can think of some conceptions of god for which it is true . but once again i m open to the posibility that i could be wrong . so give me some examples of predictions of the statment god does not exist . here is one that i can think of . if true , then there would be no healing or miricles . but this can in principle never be determined one way or the other . there are cases in which people seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no known reason . these situations do in fact happen . they are consistent with a theistic hypothesis , but in no way support such a hypothesis . we agree here . they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis . i can not think of one prediction from god does not exist that isn not of this type . but i might be missing something . the rapture will not happen on october 28 1992 . said rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened , although its failure to happen does not , of course , falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it . no phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its explanation will ever be observed . that about sums the whole thing up . bob singleton  cheers simon  simon clippingdale department of computer science tel 44 203 523296 university of warwick fax 44 203 525714

4			hospital	health	cancer	cost	dr	healthcare			 price controls for medical care was re we are from the govt . loss leader argument does not wash  thanks to kim for following up . i was hoping that someone would bring up the issue of cost compensation . the problem with the argument is that it fails to explain why kidney dialysis rd services have expanded massively in the last decade . after all , no one is forcing private providers to offer this service . if they are losing money on the treatment which according to information i have collected from several providers they are not why would they not simply limit their losses by cutting back on services engage in effective rationing of supply rather than expand the coverage to a larger market that must then be compensated by raising prices in other areas ?  perhaps there is a competitive advantage in there after all . would not reputable and dedicated physicians prefer to affiliate with an institution that offers dialysis services ? would they not therefore tend to admit patients in greater numbers to an institution that offered a full range of diagnostic and treatment options ? undoubtedly . in fact , it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that in part complicates and undermines a simplistic free market analysis of the market for medical care . hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high tech , high price machinery . they manage to make it up on other charges . once again , there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis . although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients , rd is still a profitable service . otherwise , one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred .  remember , the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market .  then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an array of products at prices below cost ? are not grocery stores embedded in a relatively free market ? can you spell loss leader ? i knew you could . grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it . in fact , your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained . but the evidence does not support this contention . rather , it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower cost technology to provide comparable benefits . providers continue to profit from rd , they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have . there is no question that had price controls forced the price of rd substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free market advocates would have been seen restriction of service , lagging technological development , etc. likewise , it appears that in the va and armed forces medical care systems , where providers are government agencies , some of these negative impacts may occur . rd patients in the va system in spokane , for example , must travel to seattle , 300 miles away , for treatment . the bottom line , however , is that this is an example of government intervention of a rather extreme sort that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers . claims that government bureaucracy inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account . jsh  mark  steve hendricks domain one thing about data , it sure does cut uucp . uunet ! isc br ! thor ! steveh the bulls t . r . hofferbert ma bell 509 838 8826
4			ethic	california	finance			 california insurance commissioner endorses federal legislation to protect consumers from scam insurance companies here is a press release from the california department of insurance .  california insurance commissioner endorses federal legislation to protect consumers from scam insurance companies  i may be a little dense but i would have thought that protecting consumers from scam insurance companies would be the prime objective of something called the cal insurance commission . if they aren not accomplishing that now then why do we need them ? very simple . an insurance commissioner is a bureaucrat a regulator . it is his her duties to make rules to enforce laws . he she cannot make laws . if there is no law that covers a specific subject , say scam insurance companies , a regulator cannot create one . so they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted . for the california insurance commissioner , there are two possible legislative bodies the california state legislature and the u.s. congress . we all know how little the california state legislature accomplishes , esp . garamendi wants the feds to do it , because a he has a better chance of getting a federal law through , and b since many of the scam have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions . john eaton ! hp vcd ! johne

4						 rejoinder . questions to israelis nf id n cdp 1483500352 000 3446 rejoinder . questions to israelis to ten questions to israelis dear shai , your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory . in the answer to my first question , concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality , your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters , according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality le um . the former is used on passports etc , and the later for daily identification in israeli society . i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places , almost every day . these id cards make clear who the holder is , a jew or an arab . you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided . but do you really believe that this is the reason ? could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ? in the answer to my second questions , concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders , you state that israel's borders were shaped and reshaped by both war and peace . according to what i read , the first zionists in the beginning of the century , had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan . i also read that it was the express wish of ben gurion to not declare israel's borders , when israel was established , as this might restrict israel's opportunities for later expansion . israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there 2000 years ago or that god promised the land to them . but according to biblical sources , the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq . and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today ? finally , if israel wants peace , why can not it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders , which might be a base for negotiations ? having all the above facts in mind , one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism , as a number of wars have proved 1948 , 1956 , 1967 , 1982 . your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official . i don not think your answer is honest you refer me to vanunu's revelations about israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations . now if he said the truth , then why should he been punished , and if he lied , why should he be punished ? i would appreciate more honesty . somebody provided an answer to the fourth question , concerning hidden prisoners in israeli prisons . he posted an article from ma ariv documenting such cases . it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel . what do you think about that ? you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to cast aspersions upon israel . such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute . if my questions are not disturbing , they would not call forth such hysterical answers . my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts . i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications , but alas you have failed to do so . i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion . this is a sign of weakness , not of strength . i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth .

5			controversy	jesus	religion	christianity	christ	miracle	god			 did he really rise ? the two historic facts that i think the most important are these  1 if jesus didn not rise from the dead , then he must have done something else equally impressive , in order to create the observed amount of impact .  2 nobody ever displayed the dead body of jesus , even though both the jewish and the roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so it would have discredited the christians .   michael a . covington internet artificial intelligence programs phone 706 542 0358 the university of georgia fax 706 542 0349 athens , georgia 30602 7415 u.s.a . amateur radio n4tmi and the two simplest refutations are these 1 what impact ? the only record of impact comes from the new testament . i have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate , and that the recorded impact actually happened . i find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse , an earthquake , a temple curtain being torn , etc. the earliest written claim we have of jesus resurrection is from the pauline epistles , none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event . 2 it seems probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because no one knew where it was . i personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples , or by graverobbers . don not bother with the point about the guards . it only appears in one gospel , and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make up in order to counter the grave robbing charge . the new testament does record that jews believed the body had been stolen . if there were really guards , they could not have effectively made this claim , as they did . scott o .
5			faith	religion	ethic	theology	christianity	belief	reason	god			 the arrogance of christians unfaithfully yours , pixie ps if you do sincerely believe that a god exists , why do you follow it blindly ? do the words question authority mean anything to you ? i defy any theist to reply . dear defiant or unfaithful or pixie i will take up the challenge to reply , as i am a theist the foundation for faith in god is reason , without which the existence of god could not be proven . that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise , traditional proofs for the existence of god , and summa theologica . now , given that god exists , and that his existence can be proven by reason , i assert that his commands must be followed blindly , although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith . why ? because god is the first cause of all things , the first mover of matter , the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence , the measure of all that is perfect , and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos . i next assert that god is all good . if this is so , then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil ; i.e . the absence of the good . and , since god can never contradict himself , then by his promise of a savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis 3 5 , god instructs that because a human adam was first responsible for man's alienation from the source of all good , a man would be required to act to restore the friendship . thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah . now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john 14 6 . if this claim is true , then we are bound by reason to follow him , who is truth incarnate . you next seem to have a problem with authority . have you tried the united states marine corps yet ? i can tell you first hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority . if you have not yet had the privilege , i will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned , and thus must be followed blindly . one may not deny the truth . for example , when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton's head , he could have denied that it happened , but he did not . the laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not . they are true . therefore , the authority which is truth may not be denied . qed   boundary no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra ; no he venido a traer la paz , sino la guerra mateo 10 34 , vulgata latina

4			gun	violence	murder	gang	cop			 my gun is like my american express card what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion . in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs . gang members . of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time ? of course they don not and that's the point i was trying to make . every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in . the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers . so ? look in the trunk some time . heck look at the dash . that funny thing attached with a quick release is a gun . the ones in the trunk are better . i don not have numbers for chicago , but philadelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and thousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s . not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you are a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi auto handguns you are going to be at a disadvantage even with training . what is the nature of this disadvantage ? if the cop can shoot , 6 rounds will do the job against a single opponent especially since the cop has guaranteed backup . if the gang member can shoot , the extra rounds don not help . the only time this difference can matter is if neither can shoot , and cops aren not supposed to be throwing lead around like that . btw most cops carry multiple guns . you are not supposed to know about the second , third , and so on . i have been at a shooting range where gang members were practicing shooting . how do we know that they were gang members and not undercover cops or even law abiding menacing minorities . btw why the sneer quotes ? they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren not doing too badly either . then the extra rounds won not make any difference , so why is it an issue ? andy

3			dinosaur	bone	animal	muscle			 philosophy quest how boldly ? lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing forces . that means that much more energy would be required for the creature to function . the bones also supply leverage points for pushing and lateral movement . that's why you don not find large active boneless creatures on land .  hydraulics can make rigid tubes . no energy required just for support . hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large forces with weak muscles , using the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a lever . this is one of those yes , but things . it's true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube , but even at 2000 psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily , though it's straight on compressive strength is high , and it's torsional resistance increase is practically nil . on the other grasping member , there's no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature . tree roots are an example . given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases . it's interesting to note that , on land , creatures are either two legged or 4 legged , with tiny insects having 6 or 8 legs , but never 3 legged , though that would be a stable configuration . it can be argued that 2 legged creatures  kangaroos are 3 legged . the specific number of limbs a creature has is an accident of evolution , it is hard to make changes in some structures . the panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its ancestors five ? on each hand , but the thumb is a modified wristbone rather than a modified finger , and extra fingers are much more common than extra limbs , especially fully functional ones . kangaroos 3 limbed ? i don not think so . if you take the view that the tail is a limb , then monkeys and kangaroos are 5 limbed . i think the tail is a different kind of structure , grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo , but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion . i don not know much about panda thumbs , so i will ask is it opposable ? thermodynamic considerations of surface volume relationships would seem to dictate that active complex creatures stay in a size range similar to what we see about us . 6 inch tall intelligent aliens seem unlikely , as do those much larger than the elephant .  why can not a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent ?  yes , i know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus , but so far space aliens are also mythical . well i won not say flat out that they can not be intelligent , but i will don not think it's likely . first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with , or greater than , human tool use and tool building . ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it's enviroment in a planned way , it will do so . that's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence , but it will suffice for a putative technological alien . now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought , but it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity . this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells , and their interconnections . so a creature the size of a lemur wouldn not have enough neurons to support complex thought . this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur . there's room for a large brain , though no indication that one ever developed . one reason this may be true is neuronic speed . the electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate . this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures . so there's little selection pressure for such brains . instead , a simpler distributed network evolves . this doesn not rule out intelligent dinosaurs , but it points in that direction . then there are the thermodynamic arguments . a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio . i contend that a creature that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won not have the time to develop and exercise intelligence . that argument may be somewhat weak . the dinosaur's problem is the reverse , it must moderate it's heat production because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat . i m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function . so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based . that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence . some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded . but for a creature the size of a brontosaur , it's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat . whales are similar size , but they can reject heat to the ocean , a much more efficient sink than air . i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself , a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary . ie monkey curiousity . i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity . gary  gary coffman ke4zv you make it , gatech ! wa4mei ! ke4zv ! gary destructive testing systems we break it . uunet ! rsiatl ! ke4zv ! gary 534 shannon way guaranteed ! emory ! kd4nc ! ke4zv ! gary lawrenceville , ga 30244

5			jesus	religion	sex	christ	catholicism	controversy			 quality of catholic liturgy  on palm sunday at our parish , we were invited to take the role of jesus in the passion . i declined to participate . last year at the liturgy meeting i pointed out how we crucify christ by our sins , so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd , but to no avail .  musicians , readers , and so on . new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening , the new things have to be explained , and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we are just sitting there listening or spacing out , in my case to how the mass is about to be done . in my mind , i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay people to be aware of the lord's presence . as a former catholic and now as a very active lutheran it is some of the innovations of the mass which made me leave the catholic church and return to the more traditional catholic chuch the lutherans . i spent many years as a lector reading the passion parts as appropriate in the catholic church and i found it very meaningful . our lutheran parish just instituted the tenebrae service for good friday and i was the lector for a paraphrased passion which was exceptional . i heard and learned things that i have previously overlooked in the gospels yet those facts were always there . as a matter of interest , the pastor and i were talking about the differences between the rc and lutheran church during holy week over breakfast easter sunday .  as a member of a liturgy committee , i can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating , who want to try out all kinds of innovations . the priests don not seem even to want to make any decisions of their own in many cases . i guess it's easier to try something new than it is to refuse to allow it . my wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family called music and worship at our church . our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions . it needs a strong hand to lead and guide , to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through lent and the rest of the liturgical year . additional reason for my leaving the catholic faith lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my parishes . aka wishy washy .  as you may gather from my comments , i feel that it is very important , ir the true reason that we are gathered there . i am quite comfortable in a traditional mass , with receiving holy communion on the tongue , the sacrament of penance not reconciliation , stations of the cross , so on and so forth . the reason other types of masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by everyone . i want more people to attend church and to find the lord , but i don not want them attending a show . it's not . my church works hard to have a meaningful service during lent on wednesdays , but follow traditional lutheran book of as the hymn of praise it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is not there . quite frankly , it is very hard for a non catholic to go to a mass and fit in . my dear wife never could former methodist . and holy week masses and vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non catholic . those catholics who have beared with me this far understand what i mean . please keep in mind why we are there to gather together in worship . not to worry about how something is done or not done . if there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing , by all means talk to your priest or pastor . i have only ever met one who wouldn not listen . they are there to provide spiritual guidance and to help . use them . my differences with the catholic church are much more fundamental but my decision to change faiths was done with prayer , intervention , and sessions with priests and ministers . in christ , kershner  kershner wyatt my opinions are my own and aren not necessarily my employer's .

5			morality	faith	religion	ethic	christianity	belief	god			 christian meta ethics in russell turpin  the issue , then , is this  christian a says , behavior such and such is sinful . what is christian b supposed to do with such a statement ?  one possibility always exists a may be able to persuade b that the behavior in question does exhibit a failure in loving god or neighbor .  michael , modern liberal that he is , reads a fairly benign meaning into this word he then constructs his religious beliefs around this understanding , reading other scripture in the context of these commandments , with love benignly understood . i regard love as no more or less benign than any other christian does . you are merely expressing approval of the consequences i find therein . which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my or any religion . love is a highly ambiguous word , of which christians can write both the gentle words paul uses of it in 1 corinthians in a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you and the words of t . s . eliot in his pentacost hymn , love is the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame . this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise in my note , as will become more evident below . as a non believer , i find michael's christianity kinder and gentler . blechhh . i think you are misreading me , rather seriously . though , given my principle that one cannot force one's own notion of sin on another , and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism , russel turpin and others believers and unbelievers alike are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of christian love . if i take him at his word , he cannot condemn the inquisitors , because they were also following these commandments as they understood them . if you misread . i can do and have repeatedly done a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of god in near succession . please go back to my quoted words above the possibility that always exists is that i or , to revert to proper time sequence , my predecessors over the last several centuries could persuade christian b of my case that the inquisition does indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love . i must also note that the majority of christians have been so persuaded . by christian argumentation , as well as by secular both christian and non christian prohibitions . what mr. turpin alludes to is a trickier point a . i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the inquisition . b . the inquisitor responds that mother church must , however painful this seems , discipline her children for their own good in this case the salvation of their souls or if the tortured heretic will not recant , than by bad example deterring others from the same loss of soul . a . i point out that this justification of a failure in love depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable . b . burns me at the stake . my rhetoric has failed , but the point i am making is sustained . what is going on here has a lot to do with cultural baggage . in this case , the baggage includes a nearly universal , and absolutely secular belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture . the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those places where it has been eliminated , or at least greatly reduced has very little , if anything , to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b . mr. turpin is pointing out that , if i am a versus the grand inquisitor's b , then my persuasion is not very likely to work . i know this ; and in what ever personal agony , i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney . so , one possibility fails in this case as it will fail in may others . at the other extreme , the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not , if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the inquisitor . and that is potentially an even more troubling case , in that many of the victims of inquisition will have accepted that they were in fact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them . the point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and given the main thrust of the inquisition , against heresy , it is bound to break down in precisely the worst cases . the conservative i don not think that is the right word , btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b above , that he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works to a greater good . but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel , as if one's theories about sin entitled one to cast aside jesus words on dealing with sinners cf matthew 5 39ff . i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously . or , for that matter , what does it mean to love one's fellow man ? and what is the right thing ? and how does one go about loving god ? well , the whole point of making these the base commandments is that they aren not reducible to rules . a set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting . such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies but not if they are used instead of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions . the great commandment is , more than anything else , a call to act as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action . a demand that i , like most , would rather not hear , but it keeps popping up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important that i be open to trying this , than succeeding at it . conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don not keep your rules . they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept ! that such idiocy is how god acts . that , after all , is the standard accusation against god by the atheists here and elsewhere . that the conservatives have confused their manipulative , hoop jumping notions of coercing other people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard american atheism and i quite agree with it on this point . ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo up front , much of which sounds pretty much the same , but by the specific acts , procedures , and arguments that they recommend . and different bodies of christians have , from the beginning , urged different ethical systems or in some cases , none . as a result , it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems , however popular or infamous with christianity . christianity does not have a torah . it does not have a qu ran . specifically christian scripture has very little , if anything , in the way of commandments so little that the christians who desperately want commandments go mining for them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their efforts . the one , single , thing in the gospels which jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another . i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so it is quite true that some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt ; i will point out what has to be going on in these inferences , and why there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved . you are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical system . but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system , since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do ? it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again . i am glad that a few christians , such as michael , find a benign meaning for the goo , and then interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive fashion . on the other hand , i do think that this tells us more about michael and christians like him that it tells us about christianity . i think you are begging the question . why don not i and the myriads of other christians like me tell you something about christianity ? nor is this very new in christianity you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers , from the 17th century onwards , and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case .  michael l . siemon i say you are gods , sons of the most high , all of you ; nevertheless or you shall die like men , and fall like any prince . psalm 82 6 7

3			heroin	cannabis	cocaine	alcoholism	marijuana			 use of haldol in elderly i have seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays . in the examples i have seen , drugs were definitely involved . my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital . he was fifty three at the time , and he was on 21 separate medications . the family protested , but the doctors were adamant , telling us that none of the drugs interact . they even took the attitude that , if he was disoriented , they should put him on something else as well ! with the help of an md friend of the family , we had all his medication discontinued . he had a seizure that night , and was put back on one drug . two days later , he was his old self again . i guess there aren not many medical texts that address the subject of 21 way interactions . i saw the same thing happen to my father , and i can more or less validate your take on hospitals . it seems to me that medical science understands precious little about taking care of the human machine . drugs are given as a response to symptoms and i guess that makes sense since all the studies that validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptoms . but there seems to be very little appreciation for the well being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test i watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital . there is something a little crazy about a system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue . it is really , really bizarre .  will estes internet

4			politics	greece	cyprus			 die zeit the massacre of turkish cypriots in paphos and famagusta . i got some email on this topic and decided to do some more reading . i thought it would be nice to share my response with everyone how about the following scholarly source ? source pierre oberling , the road to bellapais the turkish cypriot exodus to northern cyprus , social science monographs , boulder , 1982 , isbn 88033 000 7 . well , according to a book by c . m . woodhouse i have read it looks like the situation was much more complicated than either of us suggest needless to say nationalism on both the greek and turkish side was strong and began in april of 74 with confrontations over the agean as usual between the government in turkey and the ioannidis junta . in july 15 an assasination attempt against makarios then president of cyprus plotted by ioannidis , ruling dictator in greece , fails and makarios flees to england . the journalist nicos sampson takes over in a coup led by the greek officers in the cyprus national guard turkish forces which had been mobilized in anticipation begin landing on the north shore of the island on 20th of july . this caused the welcomed collapse of the dictatorship the 24th with mr. karamanlis returning from well , i am forced to disagree with you . the greeks started massacring the turkish population on cyprus in 1974 . in 1974 , turkiye stepped into cyprus to preserve the lives of the turkish population there . this is nothing but a simple historical fact . unfortunately , the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority . the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece , someday , whatever the cost to the parties involved . the history speaks for itself . greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july 15 , 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios . the release of nikos sampson , a member of eoka national organization of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist , shows that the enosis mentality continues to survive in greece . one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus , committed murder to achieve this goal , and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to greece . of course , the greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct . turkish cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the greeks eoka . if such assurances are not perfectly implemented , there is every reason to expect that the local greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate their past mistakes . on such an occasion , the turkish side may not find it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before , for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical vicious attacks . therefore it would be better to have a true federation of two separate sections living in obligatory peace , rather than another armed confrontation that would be started by the greeks and obligatorily but decisively terminated by the turks . the present greek government is trying to tyrannize the turkish population in western thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights , which were established through international treaties . one might be better advised to remember that misadventures against turkiye do not serve greece well . an offer of membership in the european common market as bait for concessions that may doom the turks in cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for greece or her friends . neither turkish lives nor turkish honor has been placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain . serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ohanus appressian 1919 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . sahak melkonian 1920

5			science	relativity	theory	mechanic	physic	gravity	astronomy			 larsonian astronomy , physics , creation the following partial summary of a theory of the universe includes a little known description of the creation of our solar system larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists , astronomers , and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations . but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years ! the late physicist dewey b . larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe , which he calls the reciprocal system , is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time  1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one component , motion , existing in three dimensions , in discrete units , and in two reciprocal forms , space and time .  2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics , its magnitudes are absolute , and its geometry is euclidean .  from these two postulates , larson developed a complete theoretical universe , using various combinations of translational , vibrational , rotational , and vibrational rotational motions , the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions , and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum .  at each step in the development , larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe , photons , sub atomic particles incomplete atoms , charges , atoms , molecules , globular star clusters , galaxies , binary star systems , solar systems , white dwarf stars , pulsars , quasars , etc . even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies , and gamma ray bursts .  and applying his theory to his new model of the atom , larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules , compressibility and thermal expansion of solids , and other properties of matter . all of this is described in good detail , with out fancy complex mathematics , in his books .  books of dewey b . larson  the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b . larson's books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe . some of the early books are out of print now , but still available through inter library loan .  the structure of the physical universe 1959  the case against the nuclear atom 1963  beyond newton 1964  new light on space and time 1965  quasars and pulsars 1971  nothing but motion 1979 a $ 9 . 50 substitute for the $ 8 . 3 billion super collider . the last four chapters explain chemical bonding . the neglected facts of science 1982  the universe of motion 1984 final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries .  basic properties of matter 1988 all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers , po box 13255 , portland , or 97213 , and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn not have each of them . several of them , including the last one , are available 1680 e . atkin ave . salt lake city , utah 84106 . this is the organization that was started to promote larson's theory . they have other related publications , including the quarterly journal reciprocity .  physicist dewey b . larson's background  physicist dewey b . larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical . he was about 91 years old when he died in may 1989 . he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university . he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used .  larson's lack of a fancy ph . d . degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him , but it is not a valid reason . sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees . at the same time , it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer , well enough to point out all their contradictions , ad hoc assumptions , principles of impotence , in consistencies , etc .  larson did not have the funds , etc. to experimentally test his theory . and it was not necessary for him to do so . he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data . and in many cases , his explanation fit better .  a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have ! they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works , but have been ignoring one for over 30 years now !  modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well . some parts of some of larson's books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree . and remember that epicycles , crystal spheres , geocentricity , flat earth theory , etc . also once seemed to explain it well , but were later proved conceptually wrong .   prof . frank h . meyer , professor emeritus of uw superior , was is a strong proponent of larson's theory , and was or still is president of larson's organization , the international society of unified science , and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity . he moved to minneapolis after retiring .  super collider boondoggle !  i am against contruction of the superconducting super collider , in texas or anywhere else . it would be a gross waste of money , and contribute almost nothing of scientific value .  most physicists don not realize it , but , according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b . larson , as described in his books , the strange goofy particles mesons , hyperons , alleged quarks , etc. which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab , cern , etc. are really just atoms of anti matter , which are created by the high energy colliding beams , and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment .  a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before , and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now !  are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the $ 8 . 3 billion cost ? don not we have much more important uses for this wasted money ?   another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables . how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider ?   naming the super collider after ronald reagon , as proposed , is totally absurd ! if it is built , it should be named after a leading particle physicist  larsonian anti matter  in larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe , anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles . it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made , in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light , which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum .  in larson's theory , a positron is actually a particle of matter , not anti matter . when a positron and electron meet , the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other .  in larson's theory , the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time , and only one dimension of space , and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half .  larsonian relativity  the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century . 531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus , earth , jupiter , etc . the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein's general theory of relativity .  but the late physicist dewey b . larson achieved results closer to the 43 seconds than general relativity can , by instead using special relativity . in one or more of his books , he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury .  larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy . he also rejected most of special relativity , including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light , and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts , those quasars with red shifts greater than 1 . 000 really are moving faster than the speed of light , although most of that motion is away from us in time .  in larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe , there are three dimensions of time instead of only one . but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe . the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time . at low relative speeds , the values of the other two dimensions are negligible ; but at high speeds , they become significant , and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor . larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this .   in regard to mass increases , it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light . but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass , a f m . orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force . in larson's theory , mass stays constant and force drops toward zero . force is actually a motion , or combinations of motions , or relations between motions , including inward and outward scalar motions . the expansion of the universe , for example , is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy .    the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion , by dewey b . larson , 1984 , north pacific publishers , po box 13255 , portland , oregon 97213 , 456 pages , indexed , hardcover .  it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author , an unrecognized genius , more than thirty years ago .  it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries , including the formation of galaxies , binary and multiple star systems , and solar systems , the true origin of the 3 degree background radiation , cosmic rays , and gamma ray bursts , and the true nature of quasars , pulsars , white dwarfs , exploding galaxies , etc .  it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for , if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds !  the following is an example of his theory's success in his first book in 1959 , the structure of the physical universe , larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies , several years before astronomers started finding them . they are a necessary consequence of larson's comprehensive theory . and when quasars were discovered , he had an immediate related explanation for them also .   gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts . they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy . but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly , and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects , except for a few cases of directional coincidence .  gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b . larson . according to page 386 of his book the universe of motion , published in 1984 , the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe , which larson calls the cosmic sector . because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe , and the way they are connected together , the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space , seemingly at random . this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects , and come from all directions uniformly .  i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth ! there would be no way to predict one , nor to stop it !  perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past , which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids , were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts !  larsonian binary star formation  about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double . but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them .  but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b . larson .  i will try to summarize larsons explanation , which is detailed in chapter 7 of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books .  first of all , according to larson , stars do not generate energy by fusion . a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse . the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron . each element has a destructive temperature limit . the heavier the element is , the lower is this limit . a star's internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays , gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements .  when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron , there is a type i supernova explosion ! this is because there is so much iron present ; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process , which larson explains in some of his books better than i can .  when the star explodes , the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light . the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light , because of the high temperature . the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light , and it expands outward in time , which is equivalent to inward in space , and it often actually disappears for a while .  over long periods of time , both masses start to fall back gravitationally . the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star . the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star . both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram .  the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space , making a single lone star again , are near zero . they will instead form a binary system , orbiting each other .  according to larson , a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface , because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time . this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter , neutron stars , black holes , etc .  larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small , then , instead of a single white dwarf star , there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star , but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat , etc . these will become planets !  in chapter 7 of the universe of motion , larson used all this information , and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe , to derive his own version of bode's law .  black hole fantasy ! i heard that physicist stephen w . hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole , and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes .  such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag , causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes , etc .  after reading physicist dewey b . larson's books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe , especially his book the universe of motion , it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies ! the strange object at cygnus x 1 is just an unusually massive white dwarf star , not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory .   by the way , i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking . the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking's severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser . it does not !  i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b . larson while he was still alive . widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson's theory , books , and organization the international society of unified science .    electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago , in connection with ufo's and unorthodox inventors , but i never was able to find out how or why they work , or how they are constructed .  i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112 113 of the book basic properties of matter , by the late physicist dewey b . larson , which describes part of larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe . i quote one paragraph  as indicated in the preceding chapter , the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance . the electrons , we find , are derived from the environment . it was brought out in volume i larson's book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities , and that , although the motions that constitute these electrons are , in many cases , absorbed by atomic structures , the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited . it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe , most of which are uncharged . in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space , because they are inherently rotating units of space , and the relation of space to space is not motion . in open space , therefore , each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system , in the manner of a photon . in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron , like the photon , is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system . all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation . meanwhile there are other processes , to be discussed later , whereby electrons are returned to the environment . the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level .  note that in larson's theory , uncharged electrons are also massless , and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate . unit velocity is the speed of light , and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light , according to larson's theory . i might have the above and below labels mixed up .  larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light !  if this is true , then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons , or other particles in space , perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion . in larson's theory , an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle .  the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds . suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b . larson has been available for more than 30 years , published in 1959 in his first book the structure of the physical universe .  it is totally un scientific for hawking , wheeler , sagan , and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics , or astronomy , etc . as well as the scientific literature and the education systems , to totally ignore larson's theory has they have .  larson's theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers , such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars .  larson's theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics , chemistry , and astronomy journals , in the u.s. and elsewhere . and at least the basic principles of larson's theory should be included in all related courses at uw ec , uw madison , cambridge , cornell university , and elsewhere , so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed .   for more information , answers to your questions , etc . please consult my cited sources especially larson's books . un altered reproduction and dissemination of this important partial summary is encouraged . robert e . mcelwaine b . s . physics and astronomy , uw ec

2			electricity	car	safety	heat	fan			 re aftermarket a c units les bartel's comments sorry i can not help you with your question , but i do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket a c units . i have a frost king or frost temp forget which aftermarket unit on my cavalier , and am quite unhappy with it . the fan is noisy , and doesn not put out much air . i will never have an aftermarket a c installed in any of my vehicles again . i just can not trust the quality and performance after this experience . les  let me add my . 02 in . i had a a c installed by the ford garage and it did not work as well as the a c that was installed by the factory in pickups identical to mine . i have talked to other people that have had the same result . don not know if this is just a probable with ford or what ?  ernie smith i agree , never have the dealer add anything to your car . if you want a c make sure it is factory installed honda's maybe excluded , many can not be bought with a c installed at the factory , but i think , maybe , they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in . as in bigger radiator etc . or are designed properly for this in the 1st place , anyway , my point is the dealer installed a c won not be anywhere near as good as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing it . scratches , screwdriver holes in seats . parts not reinstalled correctly or with all the screws etc. i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for 18 years . he said never have a dealer add anything to your car . except , maybe , floormats .
4			kidnapping	politics	terrorist	war	revenge	murder			 waco dates are these coincidental ? the atf agent interviewed on street stories reported that the raid was ill planned , and went ahead even when they the bd's knew the atf was coming . why ? i believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it , and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of president clinton . i would even suggest that the loss of 4 atf agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda . it might even be beneficial to his agenda , as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are . further proof might be that the atf denied their agents street stories report requests for sufficient fire power . important dates feb 25th nj assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban . feb 28th compound in waco attacked . on feb . 25th the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state . it looked like it might be a tight vote , but the senate in n . j . was going to vote to overturn the ban . it would not sit well to have an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban , given clintons stated agenda on gun control . i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present they were initially at the incident in waco to record the event for the tv audience . the agent on street stories reported that a supervisor was urging them all to get ready fast , as they know we are coming . i believe this attack continued , even tho the probablility of failure was high , because it came from the top down . after the n . j . assembly vote , the atf had a limited amount of time to come up with something , and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely . . rich
2			people	hockey	ranger	football	keenan	baseball			 ranger fans ? i for one am happy about the ranger's hiring of keenan . it's too bad that they didn not hire him when smith fired nielsen , maybe he could of staightened out the babies on this team and made the playoffs . what this team needs is a little fire under their butts !  reading through most of these hockey news i don not see many ranger fans writing . i m new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering 1940 ranger fan . but remember suffering builds character !  i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last dreadful stretch .  1 . knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline , why didn not we see mike hurlbut , who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first went down ?  2 . why ? is joe kocur playing every night ? he is not bob probert who is tough but also can play .  3 . how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the season . at least he plays with some heart and character , draws penalties and plays 110 when he's on the ice . was he in the doghouse for some reason ?  4 . joe cirella ? enough said !  ranger fans may be suffering but we are some of the most loyal , unlike islander fans who only show up when the team wins .  as far as the stanley cup goes i think there's only one team that can test pittsburgh and that's detroit . this would be the most entertaining and hard fought series . mario is amazing !  kurt  i think joe kocus should play every night . he is a big physical guy , and he gets the fans into the game with some big hits . both checks and fists its a big advantage to get the crowd going . plus , he helps protect the other players . notice there are very few fights when kocur is on the ice unless he is it . i have seen people start to go after essa tikkanen , only to go slinking away when kocur steps in . i think he is big asset , but should be third line , and special situation only play .    this is fast becoming a game without the goons . i admit kocur may get the fans into the game but surely they would rather see broten taking a pass from kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the rangers up 3 magic goals in the third period , rather than seeing kocur take another stupid penalty and the rangers giving up another powerplay goal ! the rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off messier and the first line . nemchinov is a perfect third line center . so who goes beezer or richter ? kurt

2			hockey	murder	lacrosse	football			 plus minus stat . it was bryan trottier , not denis potvin . it was a vicious boarding from behind . trottier was given a major . perhaps it was trottier . it happened behind the habs goal if i recall . gainey simply didn not have his head up as he was picking up the puck . but roger , what the hell does this have to do with gainey's skill as a hockey player ? if probert smashes gilmour's head into the boards next week , will that diminish your assessment of gilmour's skills ? if gilmour was taken completely by surprise , as gainey was , then yeah , i would have to say that doug wasn not playing technically smart hockey . in any case , to claim as greg did , that gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous . gainey was a plugger . and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers . grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring , bob nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne cashman , bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri richard , dick duff . and so on .  i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter . good for you . you would only be displaying your ignorance of course , but to each his own . i think gainey would be honoured to know that you have included him i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at all . on this list i also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey game . pluggers are an integral part of certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team . and that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go around . who would you rather have as your checking centre ? doug gilmour or doug jarvis ? for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres . do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey ? any team . the selke is designed to acknowledge their contribution . i think that most people understand that it's not the nobel prize . so settle down . you are wrong again . the selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger . if gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i don not see why he should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen sively . settle down ? if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down . and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth , let me suggest that you settle down before you bother following up on my postings . congenially , as always ,  jd   james david  you might consider developing your own style . after all , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not your intention . cordially , as always , rm  roger maynard

1			windows	icon	gui	macintosh	computer	mac	linux	graphic			 gui study originator c2xjfa koptsw18 cutsie little macintrash like icons that are an instant recipe for mousitis imho . system 7 is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used out of that , riscos , mswombles , and x11 simply because it does not provide enough keyboard shortcuts . windows i must confess i quite like cover your ears because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the mouse . stuff delete the user rather than making things easier and there should always be the option to do it your way if you want to , which is why i like the unix x combination so much it's so customizable .  hear ! hear ! i agree completely . one thing i can not stand about the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use the mouse what if your mouse breaks your whole system is down ! i like the mouse it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around , etc. but for most work , the keyboard and hot keys are 10 20 times faster than using the mouse . sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user , but how long is it before your are experienced ? a month ? two ? speaking of pcs at the moment . i don not think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces , which usually allows you to do more in less time if you are experienced . all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on unix especially since unix is at least 500 more powerful than dos .  and at least 500 more user unfriendly as well !

3			wiring	electronics	electricity	wire			 a question about 120vac outlet wiring .  hmmm . how are those orange isolated ground outlets often used in computer rooms wired ? they require two separate grounds . one ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet , and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's mounting tabs and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate , if any . the box faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground . the outlet ground pin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is , in turn , connected to the building entrance main ground by its own wire . so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the building's service entrance . but one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building , while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolated ground outlets of that panel . if someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a 600v feeder to ground , the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows , while the isolated ground will remain relatively noise free .

4			arson			 your evil tax dollars at work , was re atf burns ranch etc etc . mark mark sachs , representing the students for oh ? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places ? in particular , three different places where there were no apv's ? well , i only saw it start in one place . a tank punched a hole in a wall , and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that a 30 mph wind was blowing . i saw a diagram in usa today yesterday , and fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made . a terrible , negligent accident . and if the government did start the fire , then why weren not people trying to get out of the compound ? maybe they couldn not . i have often marvelled at how people could get burned alive in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire , but it happens all the time . what if they were in sealed rooms , trying to avoid the gas , and didn not know about the fire until it surrounded them ? remember the israelis hiding in sealed rooms during desert storm to avoid gas bearing scuds ? cripes , mark , are you really a college student ? maybe you ought to stop worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head . ever heard of questioning authority ? and besides . oh , i don not know why i m even bothering . ok , i will buy that . you do seem totally clueless . i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the contrary . wellllll . they weren not murderous . they would never harmed or even threatened anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons and hardware . and as far as evidence , what are you talking about ? everything the feds have said they have retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about it . maybe you and your increased beverage access buddies , sitting around the bar slurring stuff like they shoulda killed em all 51 days ago don not feel that way , but then you are probably one of those people still saying about klinton give the guy a chance , we don not even know what he's gonna do ! burp thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under the bush administration . what would your answer be then ? would you still prefer to believe the cultists ? no , i don not really expect a response to that challenge . no problem , you don not have any questions that scare any of us . most of our minds are apparently more developed than yours . the answer is yes ! in a f cking heartbeat ! thought experiment would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth open , blissfully sucking up anything the feds said if bush were the president ? what , no comeback ? ok , go ahead , say it . read my lips , no new taxes p but then again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office . um , isn not that how all politicians are elected ? not in such a great degree . bush broke one promise , maybe two taxes guns and we held him accountable for it . of course , it took him the better part of 4 years to do it ; slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots of them . anddd . i imagine he will also be held accountable for that . i can just see the campaign buttons now abc anybody but clinton so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty people ? are they , like , just plain evil , or what ? did they just wake up one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states to figure out who to oppress that day ? i m eager to know . hmmm . apparently you just got here . nobody's claiming that it was anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally don not get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up . and as far as how they picked the davidians , who knows ? maybe they figured that nobody would care about such a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the texas prairie . maybe they figured they would just go in there and run roughshod over the bds during their religious services which was the reason the feds gave for the timing of the raid rather than running into resistance . maybe they knew that the bds weren not anywhere near as violent as the feds spin doctors are trying to tell the public . maybe they were afraid to try this kind of thing on the crips and bloods . maybe it was because the atf's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case . of course , their reasoning doesn not matter , only what they did , and this time , people are just paying more attention to it . and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader ? not if you mean that stupid don not stop thinking about tomorrow . how is he on diabolical laughter ? all i have ever heard is hillary's diabolical giggle . waffle man seems to have lost his sense of humor . does he look good in a cape ? don not know , never seen him in one . he probably looks fat and puffy faced , just like in a suit . i saw him in the rose garden the other day , and i couldn not get over how much he is starting to look like teddy kennedy . these things must be investigated . you first don not worry , these things will be investigated . now go back to your beer , you dimwit .  i have heard a lot of people compare bill clinton to jimmy carter , and i would like to go on record as saying that i don not think that it's fair . jimmy carter was a veteran , and he had personal character . and even though i can not agree with carter's policies , i always believed that he was telling the truth , as best he understood it . i can not say that for the fat cat .  ken whitehead

2			injury	hockey	sport	football			 potvin and his stick dino getting shots in front of the net , he should expect it . this is playoff hockey where anything goes . you lose one game in the regular season , and it's not so bad . you lose a game in the playoffs and it's a difficult thing to overcome . i have watched hockey and played it too for a number of years and i haven not seen one post season game where the forward in front of the net has not finished without any bruises on the back of his leg . the leafs are not doing a good job in clearing the net and potvin has been forced to take matters into his own hands . i remember when cicarelli used to play for the london knights ohl , he always was a nuisance in front of the net and the goalies took exception to this . he also complained in this morning's paper about what happened last night , but to me , it's a lot of bellyaching . his team is up 2 0 and he complains about being whacked . i wonder what would happen if he tried to do the same thing in front of billy smith or a younger ron hextall ? seems dino would need two artifical legs . dino should take it as part of the game and thank his lucky stars that he's in the playoffs and has a good chance to go the finals . well , i agree that if you are going to stand in front of the net , that you should expect to get hit and hacked at . in general , you should expect to finish the game with some bruises . however , there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another player . felix potvin , imo , crossed that line on wednesday . that two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line . i lost a lot of respect for potvin because of that . it showed an immaturity . he did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area a legal position for dino to be in . instead , he slashed in an attempt to injure . it was out of shear frustration . as a leaf supporter just a supporter , i m not a leaf fan really , i was very disappointed . you are right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall at least in his philly days . they both crossed that same line at times and for that reason , many fans and players disliked them that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues . let's hope that felix doesn not do that again . i would hate to see anyone even dino although i admit i don not like him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but intentional use of the stick . gary

3			electronics	audio	cds	cd			 8x oversampling cd player oversampling , cd , digitized audio  hello  i just bought a new portable cd player for the office , and i notice that it proudly proclaims 8 times oversampling on the box . now while i think i understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor , i don not understand this 8 times business . it seems to me that when i bought my first cd player was it really 10 years ago ? ! the specs said 4 times . could someone please tell me whether i m getting senile ? if i m not , then what good does it do for the player to take samples at a higher rate ? if i really wanted better fidelity , wouldn not i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording process ? furthermore , am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate from the player's point of view as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium ? does this mean that the data rate related to the rotational speed of the disk has changed since 1983 ? note i just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself , from various people on the net , so i could be wrong . the data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such , of course , and eventually gets turned into 44 . 1 khz , 16 bit , two channel data . oversampling takes two discrete data points , and interpolates n 1 points between them for n times oversampling . when i asked , people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation , but significantly more complicated . anyway , then , the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective sampling rate up to n times 44 . 1 khz , in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters . for the same quality filter , higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters , whereas for the same price filter , higher oversamplings lets you build better filters . so , assuming the quality of all other components in a cd player remained the same , oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti alias filtering . joel kolstad

5			faith	religion	skepticism	belief	truth			 the arrogance of christians .  are all truths also absolutes ? is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes ?  the answer to both questions is yes .  perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then . to me , an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , situations , etc. true in every instance possible . do you agree with this definition ? i think you do  similarly , all truth is absolute . indeed , a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms. when is something absolute ? when it is always true . obviously , if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms. i agree with carol here . determining absolutes is , practically speaking , a waste of time . and we easily forget that relative truth is , in fact relative . for example , i recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at ? i got the answer 212 degrees consistently . i asked if they knew what scale , and was told it's just 212 degrees . any scale . that's what all thermometers say . well , that's sincere , and may be true in the experience of the speaker , but it is simply wrong . it is not an absolute truth . similarly , scripture is full of truth , which we should nurture and cherish , but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point . then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip , devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism , imo .  example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example . there may be an absolute truth behind the writing , but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians , and not necessarily elsewhere . the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth , which was having a lot of trouble with order . is it absolute truth to me ? no. and i see no compelling , or even reasonable , reason that it should be .  evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth . and there are plenty of other examples . can you reconcile this ? even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally . i have yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally . the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way .  many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world . such a statement is terribly self contradictory . let me put it to you this way . if there are no absolutes , shouldn not we conclude that the statement , there are no absolutes is not absolutely true ? obviously , we have a contradiction here .  i don not claim that there are no absolutes . i think there are very few , though , and determining absolutes is difficult . i agree . very few . and even if we knew them , personally , we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another . the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference , since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me .  there is hardly consensus , even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation .  so ? people sometimes disagree about what is true . this does not negate the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe . i can not prove the existence of absolutes . i can only rely upon my experience . i also trust god's revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite . therefore we can not comprehend the absolutes . so i don not need them . i can never know the essence of god , only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god's creation . so the reality can be that there are absolutes , but it is of no practical importance . it's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect , but copies may not be . swell . who cares ? it doesn not affect me in any practical useful way . i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens , and that they live on mars . maybe god did . so what ? is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor , or god ? whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch ? no. this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning . christianity is true , wonderful and sensible . it appeals to reason , since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god . explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world . note i m not claiming there is no place for authority . that would be silly . there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian . authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others . authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that , and is generally agressive . good parents like god are authoritative . many christians are simply authoritarian , and , not surprisingly , few adults respond to this treatment . larry overacker   lawrence overacker shell oil company , information center houston , tx 713 245 2965

2			innocence	science	ignorance	stupidity	information			 plus minus stat post 51240 of 51243 newsgroups rec . sport . hockey subject re plus minus stat  discussion deleted  good for you . you would only be displaying your ignorance of course , but to each his own .  roger , i m not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion . but hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by all means go ahead . that's if it makes you feel better .  to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious . your hockey education is not my responsibility .  my hockey education ? what the f are you talking about ? i m not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement .  my word , such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey . why does he bother you so much . he was an effective player for his style of play .  he was just another player . to laud him as anything more i find bothersome . i hated the habs . i hated lafleur until i realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever skate in my lifetime . why would anyone talk about gainey ?  i hate the habs ? you sound like a 10 year old . this statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about hockey . don not give me this crap about cogent arguments . i have yet to read something of yours that is cogent . you consistently argue with 1 emotion ; 2 huge , sweeping statements  frankly , you have a very unconvincing style .  i m not defending bob gainey . frankly , i don not care for him all that much . but your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is tiresome . it has no basis in anything . how many calders did he win ? i think it was four go ahead and refresh my memory . what about the conn smythe ? was that a fluke ? yeah , not the makings of a hockey superstar , i know , but try to have a reason , any reason , to shoot him down .  go around . who would you rather have as your checking centre ? doug gilmour or doug jarvis ? for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres . do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey ?  i m really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here . why don not you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ , himself , in nets ?  did he play hockey at a high level ? was he any good ? if not , why would you bother to bring jc up ? i am talking about hockey players here . if you can not follow the conversation don not follow up . as i said previously , it is not my responsibility to educate you .  hey cowboy ! you are the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieux . you figure it out .  now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob gainey with guy carbonneau , you would have a balanced comparison .  sure . two journeymen . big deal . neither one of them is worth discussing .  how many individual awards between them ? eight . i don not remember once again , please feel free to refresh my memory . and try to be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education .  i m wrong again . hmmm , let's see . where was i wrong in the  i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter .  oh my god ! did i say that ? roger . what's your point ? fuhr is a goaltender , goaltender's don not plug . in his prime , he was one of the best sanderson was a scrapper . if you stick him on you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era .  first place ? i m only guessing here , rog , but i have a feeling that you have setup a you are wrong again macro key on your machine .  that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time responding to any of your , or greg's , postings then i will be sure to implement that very macro .  oh roger , you shouldn not . really . i don not deserve this . you are far too accomodating already .  i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers . grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring , bob nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne cashman , bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri richard , dick duff . and so on . demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the game . so yes , settle down . nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods .  tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god . and greg ate it up . and that is what this thread is all about . if you didn not know that then why are you responding ?  you seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into your sweeping , vacuous statement . that's why . if you want to debate gainey , go ahead . but why bring up everybody else ? how does it support your argument ? do you have an argument , or do you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us ?   and as for blanket disregard for these individuals , i can remember leaf teams , purely populated by such individuals , winning four stanley cups . teams. no one ran around telling us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the world .  great . i couldn not agree more . the flyers won two cups for the same reasons . deservedly so . so what ? i don not get it . are you angry that the leafs didn not get more recognition ?  you seem to think these pluggers are hyped . i don not agree . plain and simple . if you are last statement is some sort of compromise , fair enough .  you might consider developing your own style . after all , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not your intention .  c mon . it has a nice ring to it . and admit it , you had a good laugh .  right . i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were a complete joke .  not a pleasant bone in your body , eh rog ? why are you so unhappy ? not getting invited to enough parties ? what ?  in the future , if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize .  roger , why are you under the impression that responding to your posts is some great honour ? you really should stop . it sounds a little bit pathetic . frankly , it's about as honourable as a good fart .  congenially , as always ,  jd   james david s james david western business school london , ontario

2			baseball			 dodger question the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more left handed pitching . so far , no takers . personally , i think harris is a defensive liability , and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays , or at least been among the leaders .  sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day , he can get the job done . if sharpy played just one base every day , say third , he would also improve defensively .  wallach has helped tremendously on defense , as has reed . the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff . both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays . martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years .  astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances . the dodgers are turning double plays , and keeping more balls in the infield than last year . and piazza has also been great on defense . he has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first  wallach , clearly , has contributed to the over all improvement on defense . but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs . but i don not think he is as bad as his current average . i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs .  dodger

2			car	sex	motorcycle	fashion	speed			 maxima chain wax and mail order i bought it , i tried it it is , truly , the miracle spooge . my chain is lubed , my wheel is clean , after 1000km . i would try it on the vfr , but goddamn competition accessories hasn not mailed my order yet . hell , it's only been two weeks and i was ordering some pretty bizzare stuff . like a clear rf 200 face sheild , and a can of chain wax . bastards . for what it's worth , i got my can in three days from chaparral . that's ups ground from ca to ut , ymmv . the stuff seems to work , and it doesn not attract grundge like pj 1 blue does . i gave it the acid test , a full day's worth of breaking in the quadracer's new paddle tires down at the sand dunes . if there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with sand at the end of the day , but the chain looked pretty clean . as far as mail order goes , if chaparral has it in stock and they can tell you if it's in stock , or about how long it will take to back order it if it's not , i usually get it in three days . competition accessories always seems to take a week or two to deliver . motorcycle accessory warehouse also takes a week or two , and after trying to buy some boots from them last week , i don not think they actually stock anything . maw was about $ 30 cheaper than chaparral on alpinestars tech 7 boots , but on monday i was hoping to get them by the end of the week , so i asked maw a completely unreasonable question do you have them in stock ? the conversation went something like this i need to know if you have some boots in stock . do you want to pay with visa or mastercard ? i want to know if you have them in stock . well , the computer doesn not show anything , i would have to call the distributer to find out if we have them . so do you have them or not ? don not you understand what i m saying ? i have to call our distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not . uh , right . so can you do it ? yea , call me back in an hour , and ask for phil . so an hour later phil isn not there , but mike says he will check , and call him back in half an hour . half an hour later mike isn not there either , but he left a note that says they will have them by the end of the month 3 weeks away . screw it , the 30 bucks isn not worth the hassle . i called chaparral and asked if they had them in stock ooh , alpinestars ? probably not , they are hard to keep in stock , but i will check . what size ? size 10 . let's see , yes ! size 10 , in blue & white , gray & white , black . i will take the blacks ! this was about noon on monday , they arrived thursday morning . once again , three days via ups ground . i like chaparral . i m not completely down on maw , they often have lower prices , but be prepared to wait . oh , and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other atv stuff , scorcher seems like a good outfit , friendly , fast , had the tires i wanted in stock , and were cheaper than chaparral too .  blaine gardner evans & sutherland

3			electronics	electricity	amplifier	equipment	transformer			 switching ps questions anyways , i have built the basic up & down converters with pretty good results 80 efficiency but i m running into problems when i try to design & build anything that puts out serious amps . i know it can be done i have some 5v 200a guts on my bench but something puzzles me i m using a simple choke as the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding but all commercial models use transformers with many windings . i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose me . what are they for ? better than that , anyone have a full schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of ? i would love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage ; that's handled by the big caps on the primary side , those which in a linearly regulated power supply would be considered the filter caps , coming right after the bridge . the transformer is just that a transformer . it's there primarily to step the voltage up or down . although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible , as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a snubber diode across it would tell you . actually , many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in . the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this in a somewhat simplified manner the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage , more or less unregulated dc rail . the energy storage or filter caps appear across this rail , as does the switching transistor . the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer , resulting in stepped up or stepped down pulses out the secondary , which are then rectified and filtered . at least one of the transformer's outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor , which acts in a pulse width modulation pwm fashion to control by varying the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary , and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary . the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will , more or less tracking the regulated output , or they may have some additional linear regulation added . you may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the pwm control which is most typically an ic is not done via a direct electrical connection ; this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated . often , the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement . while the transformer isn not the primary energy storage device in these designs , this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored ; besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a bad time as noted above , you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went in to the transformer back out again , one way or another . in some designs , this happens more or less automatically but in others , you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn not saturate , which again would have disastrous results best left to the imagination ! i m not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer ; hopefully , a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above . bob myers kc0ew hewlett packard co . opinions expressed here are not systems technology div . those of my employer or any other fort collins , colorado sentient life form on this planet .

1			character	animation	windows	icon	unicode	font	graphic	error			 vanishing font problem . a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation . when he first logs on via xdm , he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running . in this configuration , x windows applications particularly xdvi work fine . however , if he opens up a second xterm application , suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window , giving the error unable to load iso 8859 1 font . the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file , with prettier colours and other slight changes . further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour , and more significant , all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window . if i start the xterm with a different font using the fn option , no problems. it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts . note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available , so there doesn not appear to be a problem in the font directories hash tables . other than rewriting the xterm app defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best , does anyone have any ideas ? more info this is the most recent mips workstation r4000 i believe , with the most current operating system and running x11r5 . it is not mwm's fault , as the same problems occur under twm , etc.

4			politics	violence	democracy	freedom			 militia incredibly long  again , my response is , so what ? is mr. rutledge arguing that since the local and federal governments have abandoned their charter to support such activity , and passed laws prohibiting private organizations from doing so , that they have eliminated the basis for the rkba ? on the contrary , to anyone who understands the game , they have strengthened it .  no , i originally argued that the second amendment was a little bit and an anachronism . these prohibiting laws are examples why the are an anachronism . after all , laws in made by representatives of the people . these representatives of the people have already decided that the second amendment does not apply or is too broad in some cases . since these representatives feel an unconditional interpretation is not wanted , then it is probable that they majority of the people feel the same way . if this is so , it is an example of the people using their power of government . if this is not how the people feel , the people should stand up and state their wishes . i will point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment process was to require a super majority to change the supreme law , making it impossible for a majority of the people to simply change the law on a whim . simply changing the meaning based on the representatives of the people effectively destroys the amendment process . the state's , you know , are also entitled to a say under that process .  mox nix , mr. rutledge . you are the only one here claiming that the rkba is dependent on the existence of a top flight , well regulated militia . why this is a false assumption has already been posted a number of times .  no , i simple stated that the people have a right to join a well organized militia . i will note that that right could be considered protected under the first amendment's protection of peaceful assembly . unless you would consider a militia inherently non peaceful , then they have stated the same thing twice .  david veal univ . of tenn . div . of cont . education info . services group i still remember the way you laughed , the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft ; i m beginning to think you don not love me anymore . weird al
5			violence	peace	democracy	war	freedom	killing	torture	justice			 on capital punishment . safety . to the degree that means other than the death penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the peace , then these non violent provisions are to be preferred because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the final goal of protection of peace and human dignity . thanks for posting the exact wording which i had not seen previously . the part i quote above seems to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment it is to be used only when other means are not sufficient ; i would say this is a stronger restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when justifiable . i would certainly say there are cases where a crime justifies death perhaps this is the old testament interpretation , but my reverence for life would say that i would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty a new testament interpretation ? it is a matter for debate whether the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that non violent provisions do not . i don not believe it does , and i would certainly observe that in the usa , where you have the death penalty , there is a far higher murder rate than here in the uk , where we do not . matthew huntbach

3			science	tradition	folklore			 science and methodology was homeopathy . tradition ? originator . not every wild flight of fancy serves or can serve in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis . it is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about kekule . surely , there must be others . but apparently this is regarded as an extreme example of a non rational process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed . but how non rational is it ? indeed , an extreme example . it came out of nowhere . the connection kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary . i , for example , often receive conjure solutions hypotheses for solutions to my everyday problems at moments when i appear to myself to be occupied with activities quite removed . algorithms for that new software feature come when i trample the meadow on my occasional runs . alternative better ways to instruct and rear my sons arrive while i weed the garden . i will swear i am not thinking about any of it when ideas come . these ideas are not the stuff of great discoveries , of course , but my connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and occasional fits of rationality . surely it wasn not the only daydream kekule had . what was special about this one ? could it have had something to do with a perceived analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules ? yes . and he was lucky to have such a colorful , vivid image . i , alas , will never figure out why returning worms to the loose soil of my garden brought , have him count objects instead of merely count to mind regarding my 2 year old's fledging arithmetic skills . . upon close examination , is there a non rational mystical leap taking place , or is it perhaps closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model ? the latter . worms wiggling around in the dirt fascinate my son . regards , ted  ted lehr . my thoughts , opinions and questions . future systems technology group , aws ibm internet austin , tx 78758

4			firearm	gun	violence	weapon	terrorist	crime	murder			 2nd amendment dead good ! from article , by yea , there are millions of cases where yoy say that firearms would eter criminals . alas , this is not provable . i think that that there are actually few cases where this is so . it certainly is provable . around a million americans every year defend themselves with firearms. in many of these cases the defender doesn not even have to fire a shot ! the mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed . i don not like violence anymore than anyone else does . but , taking away the right of americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country . if honest , law abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels . expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns . believe me this will happen . there is plenty of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the klintonistas . the bulk of firarems are used against unworthy and unnesessary opponents . those who posessa a cool jakcet you want , those who would argue with you about a parking space , those who would take your woman . in short , trivial and worthless causes . statistics , por favor ? too much of this has ruined you cause . there is no recovery . in the near future , federal martials will come for your arms. no one will help you . you are more dangerous , to their thinking , than the criminal . this is your own fault . see my previous post that ought to set you straight . the 2nd amendment is dead . accept this . find another way . people have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the constitution says . that means that even if the 2nd amendment is repealed the people that's all american citizens fyi will still have the right to keep and bear arms. scott kennedy , brewer and patriot before david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun . atf spokesman after the atf is a cheap thug who interprets the constitution through the barrel of a gun . me
5			faith	religion	ethic	skepticism	christianity	prejudice	arrogance	stupidity	scientology			 the arrogance of christians a similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are jehovah's witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion . the doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as christians could be perceived to be arrogant . the truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here . what matters is that the doctor believes it to be true , and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents , and this could well be perceived as arrogance . let me carry that a step further . most doctors would not claim to be infallible . indeed , they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong , e.g. that in this case , a blood tranfusion might not turn out to be necessary after all . however , the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim , out of genuine concern , that is is necessary . as fallible human beings , they must acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong . however , they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable , and stand by their convictions .  virgilio dean velasco jr , department of electrical eng g and applied physics cwru graduate student , roboticist in training and q wannabee bullwinkle , that man's intimidating a referee ! my boss is a not very well . he doesn not look like one at all ! jewish carpenter .
4			gay	homosexuality	sex			 new study out on gay percentage comments originator actually , i bet you more gay bi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men , because more of them could have the option of living a straight life , and with social pressures , probably would at least try . geez , where have you been , ryan ? i proposed this theory months ago . let's take it one step further , even . if , as the surveys show , up to 33 of all men have had a homosexual encounter , then there must be an even larger percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic fantasies . but if less than 10 of the population is gay , what can we say about these people who don not identify as gay but have demonstrated gay potential . obviously , a large chunk of these people chose or , more accurately , were forced to choose by force of religion and social sanction to put those feelings aside , to be heterosexual . obviously , cramer and kaldis fall into this category . these people are the ones who are so hung up on choice . obviously , since they chose , everyone must have , and homosexuals are just flaunting their perversion by choosing not to go along with what society has dictated . of course , i m that most awful of perverts . i chose , i gleefully admit that i was heterosexual until i met the right man and chose to indulge in my homoerotic potential . take that ! elf !  elf sternberg the purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas , obscure pure reasoning , and inhibit clarity . with a little pratice , writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog ! bill watterson's calvin .

be the will of god any god who works that way is indescribably evil , and unworthy of my worship or faith . nobuya higgy higashiyama replied as , in substance , did others where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god's behavior ? it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god's actions . who is the clay to talk back to the potter ? but we find a contrary view in scripture . when god proposes to destroy the city of sodom genesis 18 , abraham says suppose that there are some good men in the city . will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked ? far be it from you , lord , to do such a thing ! shall not the judge of all the earth do right ? i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this , and can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as shame on you , lord , if you do such a thing ! there are those who say that the definition of good is whatever god happens to want . but if that is so , then the statement that god is good has no meaning . it simply says that god does what he wants . that being the case , no one can either love or obey god because he is good . the only motive left for obeying him is that he is powerful . just as it makes sense to obey a dictator , even when he tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them , because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself , so it makes sense to obey god , because he has the power to punish you if you don not . this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesis 18 and to christianity in general . any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality or of the goodness of god meaningless . however , it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases , still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result . when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history , those actions often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us . moreover , leaving the scriptures aside , and considering the natural world , i find that nature is often very different from what i might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity . origen said those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in nature . now , that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence , power , wisdom , and goodness of god . on the contrary , their absence would be such an argument . suppose that i am watching bobby fisher play chess , and suppose that every time he makes a move , i find myself nodding and saying good move ! just what i was expecting him to do . same move i would have made if i were playing . that would be a sign that fisher is no better a chess player than myself . given that he is better , i expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking , now , what do suppose induced him to do that ? or even , boy , that was a real slip he's just thrown the game away ! similarly , if god understands the workings of the universe better than i do , it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake . one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess game . if fisher wins , i revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier . however , if he loses , and particularly if i can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it , then i know that he is not as good a player as i had thought . with god , on the other hand , i shall not in this life see the total result of some of his actions . therefore , my grounds for judging that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher .  in the book of genesis , we read that joseph's ten older brothers , who with good reason found him insufferable , conspired to sell him into slavery in egypt . there he eventually became viceroy , and when there was a famine in canaan , he was able to provide for his family . when his brothers nervously apologized , he told them do not worry . you meant to do me evil , but god turned it into good . i once heard a rabbi speak on this text . he said the history of the jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion , or the people , or both . but , amazingly , those events turn out to be the saving of the jews and of judaism . the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family . but in fact , it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them . the famine that drove the family out of canaan looked like a misfortune for them . but in fact , if they had stayed in canaan , they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture . their oppression by the egyptians a few generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a disaster . but god used it to bring them out of egypt , and into the promised land . here the people built a temple , and regularly offered sacrifices . but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea , destroyed temple and city and countryside , and deported most of the people to babylon . you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion . but it was not . living in canaan , the people had been under constant danger of assimilation . again and again , they had turned from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cults , with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice . the babylonian captivity put a stop to that . never again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry . neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the babylonians ever again had a foothold among them . nor is that all . judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances . the only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice . during the captivity , with the temple gone , the jews invented the synagogue , a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures . they came to realize clearly , what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea , that god is not simply a local or tribal deity , not just the controller of the land of canaan , or the patron of the jewish people , but the creator of the world , and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere . time passed , and the babylonian empire was replaced by that of the persians , and then that of the greeks , or rather the macedonians . the ruler , antiochus epiphanes , was determined to stamp out judaism , and to this end he made the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death . again , one might think that this would be the end of judaism . but it was not . the people met for worship , and instead of reading the torah portion appointed for the day , they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme , and then discuss that . before this time , the torah , the so called five books of moses genesis , exodus , leviticus , numbers , and deuteronomy were the only books read and studied in the synagogue . if it had not been for antiochus , the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether . his hatred for judaism saved them . other examples here omitted for brevity's sake . some of you may remember that julie andrews first became famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady . when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it , everyone expected that julie , who had been so magnificent on stage , would play the same role in the movie . instead , the studio decided to go with an established screen star , and cast audrey hepburn . julie andrews was naturally crushed . but she later realized that if she had played the screen role , she would have been type cast for life as an elize doolittle type . it would have been a disaster for her . as it was , walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins , and she won an oscar for it . at the presentation , she stood there , smiling , and looking at walt disney , she said , and now , my special thanks to the man who made all this possible jack warner ! it was the most memorable line of the evening . in a similar spirit , we jews might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserved judaism , and kept it alive to this day , beginning with joseph's brothers , and continuing with two pharaohs , with nebuchadnezzar , with antiochus epiphanes . after the formal meeting had broken up , one woman came up to him privately and said , you were talking about the holocaust , weren not you ? he answered , if that is an example that came to your mind , then you are right , i was talking about it to you . but i would not talk about it to everyone , for not everyone can bear it . i assume that he meant that , without the holocaust , there would have been no state of israel . someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purposes or at least that the rabbi thought so . he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god's doing that he stirred up joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him , and that when the israelites were in egypt , god hardened pharaoh's heart , so that he oppressed the people , and would not let them go . and this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has brought about . i suggest another way of looking at it . consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue . but the log , instead of having a smooth even grain throughout , has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface . the sculptor considers the wood for a while , and then carves a statue that features the knot , that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue , so that observers will say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place . its presence is the crowning touch , the thing that makes the statue a great work of art . in reality , the knot , far from being what the sculptor was looking for , was a challenge to his skill . if the wood had not contained that flaw , he would still have made a great work of art , but a different one . so , if joseph's brothers had not sold him , god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people , but he would have done so in another manner . if judas had not betrayed jesus , if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus , but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god , if pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free , it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion , and therefore no redemption , and therefore no salvation . not so . god did not need judas sin to redeem us . if judas had done right , then god in christ would still have reconciled the world to himself . we do not know how , just as we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station , and just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked fisher's knight instead don not bother to look up the game in question i am making up this example , but the point is none the less valid . thus , we may say both 1 that god used , say , the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purposes , and 2 that the said cowardice was not god's doing , and that pilate would not have thwarted god's plans by behaving justly and courageously . what , then , are we to make of the place where god says to moses , i will harden pharaoh's heart , so that he will not let the people go ? some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet with god pulling the strings , and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work , but the work of god in him . i suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this if you see that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go , do not be discouraged , or suppose that the situation is out of my control . my purposes will not be thwarted . if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go , well and good . if he does not , i will fit his resistance into my plans , and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me . to return to the question that started this all off . is it possible that the serbs , in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia , are instruments of god's will ? first point . what they are doing is wrong , just as what joseph's brothers did was wrong , just as what judas did was wrong . they intend it for evil . if god somehow brings good out of it , that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment . second point . of course , god will bring good out of it . but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder . nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right . yours , james kiefer

2			player	baseball	pitcher	rule	pitching			 how does a pitcher get a save ? disclaimer this posting represents the poster's views , not necessarily those of ibm . the subject line says it all . what is the rule that qualifies a pitcher as making a save ? imho this is the most untrustworthy , silly stat , by today's rules , in all of baseball . my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on deck circle . also , the lead a pitcher enters with cannot excede three runs . this is a phenomenon known around work as ready fire aim . i am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only don not understand but publicly admit to not understanding . in fact , there's a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins . for the record , there are two ways that a reliever can get a save he must finish the game and either 1 . have entered the game with the tying run on base , at bat , or on deck . 2 . have pitched at least three innings effectively . a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game . i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners savers etc. for instance , a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead , blow the lead , fall behind , have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win . has this pitcher earned a win , no way . but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat , not saves . i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score . assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth . his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win . the third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat satisfaction . this again doesn not support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post mike jones aix high end development conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design . frederick p . brooks , jr . the mythical man month

2			espn	sport	softball	football	baseball	tv	soccer			 football vs . baseball was game length major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter attention spans i.e. the football crowd . invariably , all the arguments from people who don not like to watch baseball on t . v . say the same thing the games are too long and too boring . baseball is trying to find a way to shorten the games for wider t . v . appeal . if you look at it , though , baseball games last around the same amount of time as football games . the difference is that there is more action in that duration in football games . perhaps if there were more action in baseball games , you would get more of those fans to tune in . anyway , coming up with a solution to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult . on soapbox yet another reason to get a commisioner now since it's obvious that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in nebraska . off soapbox  how can you say there is more action in football then baseball . a football game consists of approximately 120 plays and the average duration of a play is around 8 seconds . this means that in a game that lasts approximately 3 hours you have about 16 minute s of action . in a baseball game you have upwards of two hundred pitches . there are very few on field strategy on field stratgy sessions ie . huddles and you always have a chance to win until the last out is made .   ah , but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock not all the time , but it happens when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often . this sense creates drama , even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's attention . in baseball , only 3 players are involved in the action for about here comes a wild guess 70 of the time ? and they are just playing a sophisticated game of catch hold the ball step out of the box adjust chains touch self in interesting locations . there's a lot of dead time with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes 8 ? 10 ? pitches or helen dell playing the organ dodger fans will appreciate that one . to the non baseball junkie this is boring . at any rate , i m not putting baseball down for this i have been an avid fan since i can remember it's just that watching a baseball game on t . v . at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie . that's what major league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game . it's because of t . v . not because football has more action than baseball .  steve conroy i m gone , man solid gone !  science applications baloo international corporation

5			faith	relativity	religion	theory	physic	gravity	god			 faith and dogma in 1r1mr8 $ bill ray  faith and dogma are inevitable . christians merely understand and admit to the fact . give me your proof that no god exists , or that he does . whichever position you take , you are forced to do it on faith . it does no good to say you take no position , for to show no interest in the existence of god is to assume he does not exist consider special relativity . it hasn not be proved , nor has it been disproved . no one has a proof one way or the other , but many people are interested in it !  i have satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of god one way or the other . the two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism . of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism , but similarly , no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism . in naturalism , any phenomenon that could be described as god is considered part of the natural world , to be studied as any other natural phenomenon gravity , for instance . for example , if a loud godlike voice vociferously announced , i am god , i exist , and i will prove it by reversing the force of gravity , and if then gravity did indeed reverse , a naturalist probably a scientist would say , boy , we sure didn not understand gravity as well as we thought we did , and that loud voice is something new . perhaps we didn not understand thunder as well as we thought we did either . i contend that proper implementation of the christian faith requires reasoning , but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you don not like , or find uncomfortable . hedonistic sexual behavior is condemned in the bible and no act of true reason will make it any less condemned . hatred , murder , gossip ; all these are condemned . is there god ordained murder in the bible ? you bet , and if god ever orders me to kill you , i will . but i will first use the gideon like behavior of verifying that god actually ordered the hit , and will probably discuss it in an abram like fashion . i m sure glad you don not know where i live , since you don not seem to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices in your head , and god's voice . i can hear you now , this is how jim jones and david koresh justify their behavior . delusional religious cults bear the same relationship to christianity that rape bears to consentual sex form but no substance . when the southern baptist church or the methodist church begin to do this then you have reason to blame mainstream religion for the behaviors of these people . or should i associate every negative behavior i witness in any non christian with you ? you seem to have missed my point . even if jim jones and david koresh were not religious people , my point remains that faith and dogma are dangerous , and religion encourages them . jim jones and david koresh also encouraged them . my point does not rely on jim jones and david koresh being religious . todd

5			jew	jesus	religion	christianity	judaism	jewish	christian	god			 a kind and loving god ! not !    this brings up another question i still have to ponder why is there so much anti semitism ? why do people hate jews ? i don not hate jews . i consider them to be like anyone else , sinners we all are . i don not know , i don not care about ethnical rights and wrongs myself , but it's evident that christians consider jews no longer to be the sole selected group of god's people while jews consider this to be the case . christian anti semitism comes from the obvious fact that the jews should know the hebrew scriptures better than anyone else , yet they did not convert to christianity en mass , thus rejecting christian love . no wonder this caused anti semitism . one might even wonder that if christianity didn not do this separation , would anti semitism have even started ? i don not see why not . where are the rest of the tribal people ? what happened to the tribes of the americas ? culture is seen as different and undesirable in the west , particular in the us with its failed melting pot concept . most tribes have been hunted to extinction , the hebrew tribe is one of the few survivers from the neolithic . of course it becomes difficult at times to separate christianity from the western experience , so perhaps you are right , perhaps it would have been a better world if the cultural experiment in christianity never happened .

5			faith	religion	christianity	religious	scientology	atheist	god			 idle questions for fellow atheists  i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population . probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis . weekends might not be so inviolate more common to work 7 days a week in a business , and instead of american atheists , we would have similar , religious organizations . a persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions . of course , people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions , but that could be fun to watch . it seems to me , that for most people , religion in america doesn not matter that much . you have extreemists on both ends , but a large majority don not make too much of an issue about it as long as you don not . now , admittedly , i have never had to suffer the bible belt , but i am just north of it and see the fringes , and the reasonable people in most things tend to be reasonable in religion as well . also , how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . the same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from the other , qualitatively . but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere , and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core , than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ; ie , how it expresses its own selfishness .  i don not bother according a higher value to my thinking , or just about anybodys thinking . i don not want to fall in that trap . because if you do start that , then you are then to decide which is better , says whom , why , is there a best , and also what to do about those who have inferior modes of thinking . idic infinite diversity in infinite combinations . i will argue it over a soda , but not over much more . just my $ . 12 what inflation has done . m 2

3			hazard	safety	smoking			 barbecued foods and health risk originator young sasquatch  some recent postings remind me that i had read about risks associated with the barbecuing of foods , namely that carcinogens are generated . is this a valid concern ? if so , is it a function of the smoke or the elevated temperatures ? is it a function of the cooking elements , wood or charcoal vs . lava rocks ? i wish to know more . thanks . from the tufts university guide to total nutrition stanley gershoff , ph . d . dean of tufts university school of nutrition ; harperperennial , 1991 isbn 0 06 272007 4 the greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use enough caution and get burned . some people suggest that the barbecuing itself is dangerous , because the smoke , which is absorbed by the meat , contains benzopyrene , which , in its pure form , has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals . however , in order to experience the same results , people would have to consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a time . rich young these are not kodak's opinions .

3			electronics	software	networking			 some thoughts on clipper proposal i envision incorporation of new standart into various communication systems , thus making it prevalent on the market & therefore cheap . the way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from communication equipment . it seems logical to provide clipper chip to the end user not as a part of phone , fax , modem & like but in the form of smart card compatible with various telecomm . products . banks will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone . natural step will be to cross reference this card to the person in the government databases or else this new version of wiretap proposal make no sence at all ; one wish to eavesdrop spell . on the particular person , not on the particular modem or phone .  as a side note , i disagree with one poster , who said he won not care about ability of the government to eavesdrop , since they can do that now anyway . clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens , making it monopoly of the government . may be , we can find examples when interceptions made by unauthorised people uncovered crimes of state officials ?   for pgp2 . 1 public key finger

2			creativity	baseball	control	coaching			 young catchers mark singer said  well , perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there . but they do have others worth playing , at least in their opinion . catcher is their weakest position , with the possible exception of second base . they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team , and they want to play olson and berryhill instead ? i disagree , in that i don not think it is a tangible skill , any more than leadership is . i don not deny that it is a real skill , and that some catchers may be much better than others at it , but i really don not see any way that we could ever know who they are . nichols's law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously .  sorry . new . don not know nichols law . a catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance . thus , mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short years . the rule doesn not apply to perceived superstars , who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead . greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can not hit . don not believe in catchers era . but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers . aren not they the same thing ? in other words , we know more than they do , so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial . either that or just stupidity . i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta , no ? of course . is it fair to the young players ? no. does it make organizational sense ? i think it does .  well if it does make organizational sense , one can hardly fault them for their decisions . i mean , please don not tell me how to run my business . especially when i m being successful . one could make the same sort of argument in other cases . pete rose , in pursuing ty cobb's record , was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet . the reds made a lot of money off that ; they also wasted the prime of eric davis . that may be good business , but that doesn not mean i don not loathe them for it .  david m . tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens ; only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose's dy cummings nobody , not even tim raines , has such soft hands
3			art	arson			 vandalizing the sky . i m wondering if vandalize is the proper word to use in this situation . my dictionary defines vandalism as the willful or malicious destructuion of public or private property , especially of anything beautiful or artisitc . i would agree the sky is beautiful , but not that it is public or private property . it's public because it belongs to everybody . no , the sky does not , at this time , belong to anyone . ownership is necessary to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the action was good or bad . if neither you or i own a brick wall , then i can not unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right , and you don not have the authority to declare that it is wrong . the owner may find it artistic or she may be call the police . this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights it's vandalism because many people power companies do maliciously waste light . maliciously implies evil intent . the lighting companies aren not going out of their way to spoil the sky . they just don not care . if they can sell you or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent of its light , they make more money . never mind that your money is wasted . it is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware . if that's what your city will buy , that's what the lighting company will sell . write a letter to city hall . please note that i m not defending light pollution . the orignial focus of this thread was space based light sources .  josh hopkins find a way or make one . attributed to hannibal

and when we finish with the armenians , we will go after the russians !   deposition of karine borisovna melkumian 1 born 1963 teacher boarding school no. 1 resident at building 2b , apartment 21 block 41a sumgait azerbaijan this is my fate i had everything , we were a happy family , and now , at 25 , i have become a widow , i m left to raise my three children alone ; the third , not yet two months old , was born in yerevan . igor and i had thought that if it was a girl we would call her raisa , after my mother in law , and if it was a boy , we would call him arsen , after igor's grandfather . i had a girl , and i , without igor , named her raisa , in honor of her dead grandmother . our family and the melkumians had been neighbors since 1965 . igor and i grew up together , we were friends from childhood on . we got engaged when i was 16 . in 1981 , when i was 18 , we were married . two children were born to us in sumgait . my daughter is now 6 years old , her name is kristina , and my son , seryozha , is four and a half . first i shall tell what happened on february 27 . that day on my way home from work i passed lenin square , where about 1 , 500 people had gathered . there were komsomol members there , and pioneers children's organization , and there were both party members and non party people there as well . all of them were shouting , there's no room for christians here ! and when we finish with the armenians , we will go after the russians ! and some even cried out , death to the armenians ! absurd rumors had been circulating about town . i became frightened . i came home , breathless , and told about everything i had seen downtown . my family couldn not believe it . my father in law sogomon markovich melkumian , wasn not home , he was at an azerbaijani wedding . by eight o clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a rock . he got out of the car but there was no one there . well i was telling him everything , too , and he said , what , is there no longer any government ? that same day igor said , papa , something terrible is happening in the city . and he said , we will stay at home , no one will drive us from our own home . the day passed . on february 28 , that was sunday , we didn not go out . we called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions , and they all said the same thing . sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an armenian from the neighboring building . ira , my brother in law's wife , and i called the police they are wrecking a car , help . we called and called , and nonetheless they didn not come and they didn not do anything . on february 29 , on monday , even though there were troops in the city , we were afraid to go to work . i called the school i had the keys to the classroom . i told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys , i wouldn not be coming in . he agreed , and even said , fine , don not come in , we understand what's going on in town , don not come in . before that , on the 28th , the ambartsumian family came over . they came to my father in law and said , uncle sergey , they broke our windows , bad things are happening in town . uncle misha ambartsumian even said , with my own eyes i saw them chasing naked girls through the streets . i don not know , he said , we should leave town . well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we should go , thinking we would go to our dacha . we got a couple of bags together , clothes , food , the bare essentials . and then somewhere around 4 45 the building manager came by and said , uncle sergey , the situation in town is bad , don not go out . my father even opened up to him and said , maybe we will drive to the dacha , it will be safer there . no , he said , it will be worse there , you will be safer at home . he said don not be afraid , if something happens i will send people to save you . after he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our courtyard all of us were at home at the time igor and i and our two children , ira and edik and their daughter , my sister in law ira , and my mother and father in law . and the ambartsumian family , there were three of them , uncle misha , zhasmen , and their daughter marina . now when they started breaking down the door i remember edik and igor told us , go in that room and close the door . close the door and calm the children so they won not hear that there's anyone home . the children started crying . suddenly ira , my brother in law's wife , suggested , let's run out onto the balcony . we the two daughters in law and the children , and zhasmen and marina raced out onto the balcony . my sister in law and my mother in law ran in and said , quick , over to the other balcony , or they will kill you all . we lived on the second floor . we needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's . at first we couldn not manage it . the balcony looked onto the street . at that time people were coming home from work , and many just stood there , watching . i pleaded and begged please , call someone , have someone come ! i even started shouting . i will throw down the children , i will throw them down , you catch them and take them somewhere , so at least the children will survive . either they were afraid or . i don not know what . they looked as though they were watching a movie . some of them started throwing stones at us . i will say it again , these weren not the bandits , these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway , they were just regular people , passersby . a bus even stopped . i remember a man's voice saying the armenians were climbing over to the other balcony . ira , my sister in law , helped us get the children over there . i was pregnant , about seven months pregnant . no , it wasn not yet seven , it was six and a half . i climbed over too . i think zhasmen went first ; you know , i just don not remember it all that well . zhasmen went first , i think , and edik's wife ira and i had the children , and they were all screaming and crying . my kristina said , mamma , don not throw us over the balcony , we are afraid ! lilia was crying , and kristina and seryozha were crying too . kristina didn not even want to climb over . she shouted , i m staying with grandmother , i m staying with grandma ! she loved her grandma , more than she loved me . and my mother in law shouted , oh no , kristina's still there , she's still there , save kristina , too ! ira helped us climb over , with kristina coming last ira helped us and went back inside . we started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door . i pounded with my fist , sevil , open the door , open it , please ! she didn not open it . no , go away , go anywhere , go , i m not opening the door . she was our neighbor , we were friends , we never refused her anything , ever ! and apparently she thought we were going to break the windows , and she opened the door . she opened it and said , karina , karina , go away , go anywhere , just don not stay here , they will kill us , too , because of you . i begged , please , at least take the children , we will leave , we will go back . no , she said , you have to leave . her sons ran in , one had a knife . sevil's brother , he's around 18 , shouted at us get out of here , leave , i will kill you with this knife ! i became terrified , i took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs . i went down and heard a loudspeaker . it was in the courtyard the armenians must be killed , they have taken all the best places , all the best apartments ! one of them said , let the armenian blood flow , none of them should survive ! when i heard that i went upstairs and started knocking on doors . no one opened their door for me ! not on the third floor , or the fourth . i couldn not see zhasmen any longer . ira came upstairs later . i even thought that they had let her stay , that they would save her . my head was spinning . they were killing my family , and here i was in the next entryway with two children . seryozha was four , and kristina was five and a half . they were crying , mamma , we are scared ! they were so frightened that i didn not even know how to calm them , should i try to calm them or myself ? it was awful . but on the third floor a man did open his door . i asked , open up , let me inside ! he opened the door slightly and said , no ! no and that was it ! he said it so sternly no ! i went up to the fifth floor . i pounded my fists on the door with all my might . he opened up , the man of the house , and stood there , looking at me . i was ready to get down on my knees . i almost did get down on my knees . please , i beg of you , at least take the children . he wasn not an azerbaijani , he was a lezgin . i don not even know how , but he let me inside . and when i went in , zhasmen was already there . two minutes hadn not passed when ira and lilia came up the stairs . lilia was crying . he didn not want to open the door . and again i started pleading , please , open the door , it's our ira and lilia ! open the door ! and he said , no , i m afraid . i said again and again , please , open the door , please ! he looked at me . he looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all . ira came in with lilia . we threw ourselves into each other's arms , crying . then the man locked us into the bathroom . we sat there for a long time . through the door he told us , calm the children , and calm yourselves down , too . calm down ? this man was hiding us , but what of our family ? when i was still in our apartment i had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive . i said , igor , edik , let's say farewell . and edik turned around and looked at me as if to say , is that some kind of joke ? all the same i thought they would kill all of us . igor looked at me , too . but it was already too late ! they started pounding on the door , igor was standing next to the door . before that he had told us , go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight . he thought we were in the room . but before we went out onto the balcony we went to them edik , igor , let's say farewell . igor didn not think we could climb over to the other balcony . and we did get over there , and i myself can not believe we were able to save ourselves . igor put on a helmet , and edik had his coat on , and he put on a fur hat . all the men igor , edik , their father , and misha ambartsumian they all stood next to the door . they thought they would pound on it a while and leave . but from the other side of the door they ordered in azerbaijani open the door ! we were all silent , waiting . someone outside the door said , they are home , they are in there , break down the door ! and i remember my father in law whispering , they are going to break it down now , it's coming down now . he had something in his hands , i think it was a knife if they got in , we were going to defend ourselves . in the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs . from outside the door they said , we are counting to five , open up ! but we were all quiet , we didn not answer them . we made like no one was home . we figured they would leave , they would get tired and leave . my father in law had said , it's not possible they would come into my home . how can that be ? everyone knows us , all of sumgait knows our family , we are on good terms with everyone . and indeed a day did not pass that there wasn not an azerbaijani guest at our table . we had a nice dacha , everyone would get together there often , azerbaijanis liked being with us there too . but now we had to save ourselves , we had to flee from our own home . ira , i remember , said , i m not leaving here , my brothers and my parents are here , i m going to fight alongside them . that's just what she said . she picked up a knife and said , if they open the door and come into the apartment then i m going to fight alongside my family , i m not going anywhere . we were at sevil's when they broke into our apartment . we heard fighting and shouting . the noise was terrible . and when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the lezgin's apartment , you could hear everything up there , too . even ira's voice . i remember her calling her mother several times . she called her for a long time . i started pounding on the door in the bathroom open the door , what are they doing to ira , who's shouting , that's ira shouting , that's her voice ! but the lezgin said , it's nothing , calm down , no , it's not in your apartment . he was lying to me so i would calm down . two hours went by and the lezgin opened the door and said , karina , igor got away , calm down . he ran away . he saw igor break away and run off with his own eyes . they killed him outside , next to the building . while we were in the bathroom i experienced every possible human terror . the way ira shouted ! she shouted , save me , mamma , save me ! . mamma , mamma ! she repeated it several times . there was a wild din . there were very many people there , all of them shouting , all of them bellowing , howling , whistling you just can not imagine what was going on , what the roar was like . apparently , after they had killed ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs , all the way up to the fifth floor . i don not know if they were just looking for any armenians or for us in particular , but i think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters in law were climbing over the balconies . and after we heard ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors . i thought those were our last moments , and started saying good bye to my children , kissing them . they were sleeping . i woke them up kristina ! seryozha , wake up ! and i tell ira ira , if something happens , we will throw ourselves off the balcony . we were on the fifth floor . apparently our lezgin neighbor had opened the door too , because later he said , i opened the door and told them there were no armenians inside . and after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see they were gone . we weren not friends with those lezgin neighbors , we only knew each other from the building . but the people we were friends with wouldn not even consider hiding us . the lezgin let us out of the bathroom . they had a candle burning . he said , karina , there are no lights on in our block . the whole block was dark , the whole block ! it's a huge block , too . the lezgin said , i m afraid to keep you until morning , i m afraid of the neighbors , they might kill me for saving you . i said , what are you saying , we will leave now . but we can not just leave with the children in the middle of the night . give us time to find somewhere else to hide . he said , well ok , go look . i asked ira , ira , do you want to go ? ira said , no , i will stay with the children , karina . i said , fine , then i will go . zhasmen and i went downstairs together . it was very dark . no one was in the courtyard it was dark , pitch black . l was afraid to go out at after seven , igor always met me after work and accompanied me home , i never went out alone . and now here i was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that , too . it was probably after eleven . later i called the boarding school and my director answered . he said , karina , where are you ? i didn not know , i was calling from a public phone outside and didn not know where i was . i got confused and hung up the receiver . from him i only found out what time it was , i asked him , what time is it ? he said 11 20 , i think , but i don not really remember . so anyway zhasmen and i went out into the courtyard i look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment . and there was the smell of something burnt . i became horrified . i looked at the corpse for a long time . it was either ira or edik . i only saw one of them , zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it hurry up , let's go . hurry up , come on , what are you turning around for ? i turned around and saw a large truck , it must have belonged to the bandits , because they came to kill us in a truck like that . we lived in the third entryway , and that truck was next to the fourth . we walked quickly , holding hands . i thought , if i go to the police then they will put me away . i couldn not count on them . before i reached the police station i saw a military vehicle . we went over and i said , soldier , in block 41 , i don not know if they have killed people or injured them we need to save them ! and he said , go to the police station and tell them everything . i said , i m afraid to go there , i m afraid of them . he said , don not be afraid . we went to the police and they wrote down the address , and the military vehicle went to our building . i didn not go with them , they left me at the police station . i gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they would rescue them , too . i didn not know where they were or what had happened to them . after a while they brought my children and ira and lilia . first they took us to the kgb , that was at two or three in the morning . then around five they took us to the city party committee , and there were very many people there , very many . i was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress . seryozha was only wearing a shirt , and kristina had a little dress on . no coat , no boots , nothing ! and we sat there for three whole days in the city party committee . the lezgin had told me that igor escaped . and i thought that he was probably alive . but then after two and a half days , they took us , the armenians of sumgait , to nasosny . on march 6 some people from the central committee came and told us , karina , ira , we need you , come with us to the city party committee . my mamma had come to nasosny , and she had been looking for me for six days . mama , my brothers , and my uncle . we went to the city party committee and waited there in the courtyard i was wearing nothing but a dress , and ira had only a dress on as well . there was a strong wind on march 6 . an hour went by . and then one of the functionaries told us , karina , ira , gather your courage . would you like to go to the burial ? i said , what , did they really kill all of them ? he said , let's look . he had a long list , and he started reading them off igor melkumian , my husband , eduard melkumian , my brother in law , irina melkumian , my sister in law , sogomon melkumian , my father in law , and raisa melkumian , my mother in law . he read off all their names and said , get in the car , let's go to the burial . we buried our family . i couldn not believe it at the time , i couldn not conceive of it or imagine it . and even now i think how shall i explain it to my children when they are older ? my children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother . kristina didn not love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother , they spoiled her . kristina would always announce , my grandma is better than anyone ! now , even though she is getting used to my mother , it's difficult for her , and once she told her you are a bad grandmother . i don not know why , i asked her , kristina , where's papa ? and she said , they killed him . she knows , she understands it all . and recently i scolded seryozha severely for something , and he started shouting at me , when papa comes i m going to tell him everything !

1			software	linux	windows	computer	hardware	graphic			 hercules vlb ? that is for my wife . i just purchased a viewsonic 17 for myself , and am looking for a graphics card to drive it . i want 70hz refresh , and would really like it to handle my cd roms. i tried the orchid p9000 , which did neither of those things though robert at wietek did say that the 70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base . so my thoughts go back to hercules . they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the graphite around the end of march . i have heard precisely zero about it since then . does anyone know if the card was actually released , and what capabilities and price it has ? hmm your cd rom program must be using some oddball vga modes . i think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month , when it is released though it will be in limited quantities , i think they have quite a back order right now the 2 megs version will come out a bit later . since you have a viewsonic 17 i think it has a 78khz horizontal frequency right ? you are gonna love the 2 megs version . it can do 1280x1024x256 at 75hz , 1152x900x256 at 80hz , 1024x768x256 at 90hz ! 1024x768x65536 at 75hz . it can also do 640x480x16 mil . and 800x600x16 bit at 90hz , too bad i don not have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours ; most of those modes need a 78khz monitor , otherwise you will have to use a lower refresh rate if you want more info . about the coming graphite vl , you should go to the ibm hardware section on compuserve ibmhw , in the video sig . there are several hercules reps there that are very helpful .  stephen lau , elec . engineering , univ . of hawaii don not have my own account until grad . school starts autumn 93 death to fm synthesis ! go gus !
3			gravity	science	space	weight	speed	size			 space manuevering tug was hst servicing mission  given that what i described for the hst seemed to be the smt ,  has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this mission ? you seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence . someone from nasa posted that there were very significant mass margins on the hst re boost mission . a while back i had asked why not carry the edo pallet up , and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough , they weren not even carrying extra suits . so how much mass is saved by not burning the oms ? that's the critical question . my data shows that the oms engines hold 10 , 900 kg of propellant . of that , a substantial fraction is going to be used for the first oms burn , the reentry burn and the reserve . so pat , tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take , and how much the edo pallet , bus 1 and extra parts are going mass . if you can make the numbers work out , then i will be interested . after you show us that it can be done , then tell us how much the edo pallet , bus 1 and extra equipment is going to cost why not do this ?  quick test goldins philosophjy of faster cheaper , better .  build a real fast space tug , to handle the re boost of the hst using clean cryo fuels , and get it ready before the hst mission .  pat , this would be slower , more expensive and worse . where's wingo when you need him come on . knock that s t off . you forget , that during skylab , they did overnight mission planning for the repair eva's . also during thexd intelsat mission , they did overnight wetf simulations . i somehow think they could train up a new eva in 8 months . first , while astronauts certainly have done evas with minimal planning , that was because they had to . they don not like to do that as a general rule . second , remember why they had to improvise during intelsat 6 ? they were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn not designed to do that . trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely . third , they don not have eight months . they have however much time is left after someone comes up with a plan , shows it can work and gets it approved . you may think i have a pessimistic attitude . i think it's realistic . i m not saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are . what i m saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under nasa management . and as for building hardware , anything can be built if you want it bad enough . you forget , the bus 1 is already built . all they would ahve to do is soup it up , even test it on a delta mission . all they have to do is soup it up ? just what does that mean ? don not get into this mode of negativism . besides , at the rate missions slip , the discovery won not launch on this mission until march . that's almost a year . more expensive your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the oms. in addition , you have added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware . ah , but how much more expensive is the second hst servicing mission . the second servicing mission is a contingency . you have neither shown that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your plan . you forget , there is a bum fgs , the solar array electronics , are getting hinky and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission . no , pat , i haven not forgotten . if the smt can avoid a second servicing mission that's $ 500 million saved . no pat . that's $ 500 million minus the cost of the new hardware , minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along , minus development and mangement costs , minus extra operating costs . tanstaafl . according to a gao report on the omv i have before me , there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle hst and axaf . since axaf has since been scaled back and hst can rely on the shuttle , there doesn not seem to be any need for your vehicle . of course , there wasn not any need for the saturn v after apollo too . i m sure that if you reread this you will see that your argument is falacious . as for the problems with the aperture door , i am sure they can work out some way to handle that . maybe a plug made from frozen ice . it will keep out any contamination , yet sublime away after teh boost pat , not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's made to perform this task , it also ignores the point . there is a desire to have astronauts available so that if the door fails to open , something can be done about it . unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door , you haven not solved the problem .  josh hopkins find a way or make one . attributed to hannibal

5			religion	murder	holocaust			 genocide is caused by atheism  if i state that i know that there is a green marble in a closed box , which i have never seen , nor have any evidence for its existance ; i would be guilty of deceit , even if there is , in fact , a green marble inside .  the question of whether or not there is a green marble inside , is irrelevent . you go ahead and play with your marbles . i love it , i love it , i love it ! wish i could fit all that into a . sig file ! if someone is keeping a list of bobby quotes , be sure to include this one !  stating an unproven opinion as a fact , is deceit . and , knowingly being decietful is a falsehood and a lie . so why do you think its an unproven opinion ? if i said something as fact but you think its opinion because you do not accept it , then who's right ? the flat earthers state that the earth is flat is a fact . i don not accept this , i think it's an unproven opinion , and i think the round earthers are right because they have better evidence than the flat earthers do . although i can not prove that a god doesn not exist , the arguments used to support a god's existence are weak and often self contradictory , and i m not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that i absolutely can not ignore . a while ago , i read an interesting book by a fellow called von daenicken , in which he proved some of the wildest things , and on the last page , he wrote something like can you prove it isn not so ? i certainly can not , but i m not going to believe him , because he based his proof on some really questionable stuff , such as old myths he called it circumstancial evidence . so far , atheism hasn not made me kill anyone , and i m regarded as quite an agreeable fellow , really .  sami aario can you see or measure an atom ? yet you can explode one . sunlight is comprised of many atoms. your stupid minds ! stupid , stupid ! eros in plan 9 from outer space disclaimer i don not agree with eros .

5			jesus	religion	christianity	war	christ	christian	hell	persecution	god			 proof of resurection we also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been wrecked on our world because of christians who were certain they were following christ from captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict obedience to the gensis command to subdue the earth , to nazi's who have justly punished the jews for the killing christ as well as the other progroms , the innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with you shall not allow a witch to live , the moslems who were killed in the crusades , the god fearing men destroyed by the inquistion . the religious wars in spain , france , england , etc. christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the instructions therein , was unquestionable . there is much to grieve .  randy very interesting , but i also believe that you have presented a misleading argument . christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate , rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand jesus christ's message , and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims , rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the new testament . with every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority , comes the inevitable fact that some many ? people will understand it in a distorted way , with inevitable consequences . the bible's message is that we are to love all people , and that all people are redeemable . it preaches a message of repentance , and of giving . unfortunately , all people have deceitful hearts , and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways . this is also a fundamental christian doctrine . one of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of western history . i think that you will find many , many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were christian . i am not saying this to justify the massacres that were , but i am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already . consider the world without christianity . i doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live , if it wasn not for the peaceful doctrines of jesus christ perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion i won not name any here , though one comes to mind which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects . point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power , greed and hatred . please don not point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial , in love for others . yours in christ , andrew mcveigh ps i believe that a line of questioning like you presented is , strangely enough , compatible with becoming a christian . certainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world , and especially christians . i praise god for jesus christ , and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to god and be forgiven , time and time again .   andrew mcveigh
2			electricity	car	motorcycle	safety	brake	fuel	speed	engine			 fast idle on 88 ford ranger it did it again . this morning , my 88 ford ranger was idling at 10 , 000 rpm . ok , so i exaggerated a little , but it was idling very fast it has a 2 liter carburated engine in it , and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal i don not think the linkage is stuck . what can i do to fix this problem ? this has been a problem from time to time , but has straightened itself out until now . i don not have a tach , but by gauging by the sound of the engine , it is idling about twice as fast as it should be . this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up at a stop light . sometimes a bad choke pull off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle . the pull off , which is vacuum actuated , provides a necessary pull in non cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam . locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle . if so , locate the diaphram and test it . if you can not apply suction via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract , then it's bad and should be replaced . bernie lofaso applied research labs
5			satan	religion	philosophy	atheist	god			 vonnegut atheism yesterday , i got the chance to hear kurt vonnegut speak at the university of new hampshire . vonnegut succeeded isaac asimov as the honorary ? head of the american humanist association . vonnegut is an atheist , and so was asimov before asimov's funeral , vonnegut stood up and said about asimov , he's in heaven now , which ignited uproarious laughter in the room . from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral it's the funniest thing i could have possibly said to a room full of humanists , vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture . if vonnegut comes to speak at your university , i highly recommend going to see him even if you have never read any of his novels . in my opinion , he's the greatest living humorist greatest living humanist humorist as well peace , dana

5			dr			 hyslop and the two babylons seeing as how the two babylons has been brought up again , its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious .  c . wingate maybe you should dig a little further charles . hislop's scholarship was accepted by the bristish oriental institute which , at the time , was the premere institute for oriental studies . as i have stated over and over , i have checked out about 25 of his references most are now out of print or in private libraries and the likes of wilkerson and layard hold their own merit . they too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself , you will find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed . both were highly honored by the british oriental museum . wilkerson is known as one of the leading archeologist in the history of egyptiology and layard is still being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the mesopotamian regions . he was recently refered to in a time article on babylonian archeology . phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions . hislop did not . his conclusions do not tickle the ears , that much is self evident . but to assert that his conclusions are spurious is without merit . he gave references to all his conclusions and as i have stated , for the last 25 years i have used his conclusions in debates at rc seminaries and brotherhoods , not to mention the individual priests and bishops that i have talked to one on one . no counter to hislops scholarship was made . the only rebuttals were against his conclusions because they do totally undermined the claims of the rcc . he was showing that the intitution of the rcc was based on the mysteries which others have shown even to this day in various articles and topics . the tongues movement in corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church . if it was so in corinth , why could they not have an influence in rome , the city of seven hills ? also , you do not have to listen to his conclusions , you can draw your own conclusions by looking at the customs , artifacts , the cerimonial dress , the docrine of purgatory , etc from the vantage of the mysteries . you don not even have to be a believer to see the parallels . just one example . the mitre . where did it come from ? why is it shaped the way it is ? what are the two tails that hang down the back represent ? was this an ancient head dress from an earlier culture and why was it in rome at the time of the beginnings of the church of the state of rome ? does it have pagan history behind it , and if so , why did the rcc chose regardless ? any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions . even the scriptures themselves refer to it . all hislop did was collect the information from all the various sources and put them in one binding . there is no lack of scholorship in that . please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation , yet present no evidence supporting it . rex

3			pain	medication	therapy			 need advice with doctor patient relationship problem i need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me . i saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain . he suggested medication and a course of treatment , and told me that i need to call him 7 days after i begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness , as well as my general health . i did exactly as he asked , and made the call reaching his secretary . i explained to her that i was following up at the doctor's request , and that i was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective . the doctor called me back , and his first words were , whatever you want , you would better make it quick . i m very busy and don not have time to chit chat with you ! i told him i was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him , and that i was feeling worse . i then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time . he responded , just spit it out now because no time is a good time . said in a raised voice . i started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and i kind of stuttered and then said well , never mind and he said he will talk to various colleagues about other medications and he will call me some other time . this doctor called me that evening and said because i didn not express myself well , he was confused about what i wanted . at this point i was pretty upset and i told him in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry i felt that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings . he told me that he just doesn not have time to rap with patients and thought that was what i wanted . i told him that to assume i was calling to rap was insulting , and said again that i was just following through on his orders . he responded that he resented the implication that he felt i was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status . he then gave me this apology i am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought i was insulting . i am not trying to insult you but i am not that knowledgeable about pain , and i don not have a lot of time to deal with that . he then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication . i am still upset and have not yet called . my questions 1 should i continue to have this doctor manage my care ? 2 since i am in pain off and on , i realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am i perhaps over reacting or overly sensitive ? if this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain i have , he still wants me to status him on my condition but now i am afraid to call him . marlena

3			sensitivity			 is msg sensitivity superstition ?  maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses ?  you mean the responses some of which pointed to double blind tests which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to msg it's elicited by the placebo as well . many people responded with more anecdotal stories ; i think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories . presumably , he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about msg making people ill . similarly , debunking such claims without doing research whether literature and lab , is equally beside the point . the original poster no doubt already knows that some people think chinese restaurant syndrome is bogus . placebos are all very interesting , but irrelevant to the question of what effects msg has . you could have real effects and placebo effects ; people may have allergies in addition .  yet again , the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of .  like youself ? someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition ? have you read olney's work ? i fail to see how citing results from peer reviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked . for cites on msg , look up almost anything by john w . olney , a toxicologist who has studied the effects of msg on the brain and on development . it is undisputed in the literature that msg is an excitotoxic food additive ,  no , it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter . there is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke , drowning and lou gehrig's disease , just to name a few . this is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods . people are not receiving intra ventricular injections of glutamate . tests have been done on rhesus monkeys , as well . i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular . the glu and asp were administered orally . some studies used iv and sc . intra ventricular is not a normal admin . method for food tox . studies , for obvious reasons . you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk . too much in the diet , and the system gets thrown off .  sez you . such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies . infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go , but they are not relevant to the matter at hand . which is not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the additive . but we have no reason to believe that msg in the diet effects humans adversely . pardon me , but where are you getting this from ? have you read the journals ? have you done a thorough literature search ? but , you are right , mice aren not the best to study this on . they are four times less sensitive than humans to msg . glutamate and aspartate , also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , and are freely available in many foods , but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food .  wrong . do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink ? milligrams worth . compare that to a glass of milk . do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein containing foods compared to that added by the use of msg ? the point is exceeding the window . of course , they are amino acids . note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine . olney's research compared infant human diets . specifically , the amount of freely available glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods , vs . typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes . he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods . mother's milk was well below the effective dose . read olney's review paper in prog . brain res , 1988 , and check his sources . they are impecable . there is no dispute .  impeccable . there most certainly is a dispute . between who ? over what ? i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever .  steve dyer aka ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c ! spdcc ! dyer hmm . com . why am i not surprised ? dianne murray

3			terrorist	hacking	encryption			 clipper considered harmful criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specificall the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user , and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed . why doing it in such a rough manner ? it is much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin compatible do nothing chip that does not encrypt at all . chances are that the victim will not notice anything , especially if it is done professionally . once a suitable collection of devices is stolen , criminals can communicate with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means . no , because the feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations . true , they will blame the wrong guys , but nevertheless one cannot say something like the drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship not erminus when the feds are listening , even if they cannot identify who the speaker is . no , the criminals will just use some secure encryption . the new proposal does not stop criminals ; it ensures that the government will be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper . to me , it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other strong encryption devices . regards , vesselin  vesselin vladimirov bontchev virus test center , university of hamburg tel . 49 40 54715 224 , fax 49 40 54715 226 fachbereich informatik agn pgp 2 . 2 public key available on request vogt koelln strasse 30 , rm . 107 c email d 2000 hamburg 54 , germany

4			apartheid	jew	politics	war	democracy			 israel an apartheid state .  i do not want to convince anyone . this is just usenet , not the real world . i just read the opinions others have about a subject , and sometimes i present my opinion . i think that this net is only useful to exchange ideas . i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything .  fine . now if your opinion isn not convincing anyone , and it's getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case , isn not it likely that your opinions need some revision ?  as i said , i do not want to convice anyone , so , why should my opinions convince anyone ? i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts . then you haven not been paying attention to the arguments levelled against them . they have been , over and over again . they will be again . first , and i repeat it , i never said that the idea of jews having the right to have a state is racist zionism , as a movement , is more than just that idea .  in a word utter and complete horse puckey . look the term up in the dictionary .  maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here . one thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary , and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time . hey , what do you think dictionaries are for ? you quite obviously need one . a good dictionary gives both , and you well know it . i think that zionism in the way it defines who is a jew , for example , is racist like .  ok , now how would you define it . and by the way , you are wrong again . there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements . you know this is the case , it's been pointed out on the net directly to you before , and yet you continue to maintain this delusion .  ok . tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way , and how many are who define jew based on a religious way . i don not think that data exist on this directly . in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira , i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now .  comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for example , with the ira in the role of pinochet . you really need to get your history straight . you also need a basic dictionary .  you need to start reading before answering . my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic , it does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic . i did not comapre israel to the ira . i think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is wrong . that is no problem . but once again you are defining zionism as one movement . you are implying that it is monolithic . you know this is not and has never been the case . stuff deleted by pinkas . his statement , which i was responding to with the below , asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic  i never said that zionism is monolithic . if you are going to attribute me things , present the quotes where i said that . you don not say it directly . you implied it , and i showed explicitly where and how you implied it . now you are trying to wriggle out of it . won not wash , and you know it . that is what makes the basis for zionist movements . however , i am not considering just that , but the rest of it .  in a word i don not believe you . your words tell a very different story . especially since they are not based on fact , but innuendo and misrepresentation .  that is your problem . i could certainly interpret this like you are running out of arguments . first , you put words in my mouth , now , you say you do ot believe me . it's you , not me , who is running out of arguments . which makes an interesting point . people living in a jewish state have shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are not the same . so , the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown us that there are some problems in a state where 80 of the people is secular but judaism is define according to religious standards , or where marriage is a religious stage , or where the law of return defines a jew according to a religious standard  no , it doesn not ! nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be religious or even believe in g d to become a citizen of israel thereunder .  why don not you try reading for a change ? did i say that the law of return demand a person to be religious ? now , how does the law of return define who is a jew and who is not ? i said that it uses a religious standard if your mother is a jew , you are a jew , if your mother is not jewish , neither you are . do not twist my words , please . what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious standards . now this can have several different meanings , and you know it . one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who are religious are defined as jews . another is to say that only those who meet the religious definition of a jew is one . and there are others . i m not twisting your words . i m trying to make you aware that your words don not mean what you think they do . true , there are debates in israel and abroad about who is a jew ? but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular . would you say that religious people should not have a say in that ? would you deny them their right of free speech ?  i am not talking about the debate . i am talking about how things are right now . when the debate is over , i will see what happens . right now , things are like they are . let me ask you one thing . i understand that israel differenciates between citizenship and nationality . suppose m ale and f emale have a child in israel . which nationality will the child's id show , according to each one of the following cases actually , it doesn not . and the citizens rights are exactly the same in both cases , anyway . a f and m are both jewish . jewish b f is jewsh and m is not . jewish c f is muslim and m is jewish . d f is christian and m is jewish . it will depend on what religion is practiced in the house . the original law of return would still admit such a person if they were jewish , if memory serves . e f and m are both non jewish . not jewish . did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non jews ? why should they still define then a jew based on what is a religious definition ?  it's called history . how do you think jews stuck together through pogroms for millenia in europe ? we had to know who was our own . i for one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent is no less legit than is matrilineal which is not the religious jew's point of view . there's plenty of room for that in zionism as you well know .  it called history . at some point it was ok . now , i believe , it is not . that's valid , as far as i can see . according to webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary , merriam webster inc , publishers , springfield , massachusetts , u.s.a . 1986 , page 593 ,  hy poc ri sy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not .  so , saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism , but disregarding the right of the palestinian people to do the same , according to this dictionary , is hypocrisy .  utter baloney . by the way , i do believe the palestinians have a right to self determination , have stated so on this net , and i know you have  seen it .   interesting . how do you know ? had i ever talked to you about this and forgotten about that ? more than once . as have others . but that right to self determination cannot be at israel's expense . israel's security comes first and that security must be maintained . you are also twisting words now beyond belief . if you think that's what that definition means in this context , you need a first grade course in english .   which definition are you now talking here about ? the very one you give above . it is absolutely inconsistent with the twist you put on it . i do not know why you are so touchy . i never said that you did not support palestinian self determination . i just gave an example of hypocrisy . no you didn not . you had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees in order to do so , and everyone else knows it . i m not being touchy . i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it . it was just an example . nothing more , nothing less than that . why did you have to clarify what you think ? because what you gave was not an example . it was an example of how the definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees . if you didn not use different meanings of words than are in the dictionary , you might be believable .  here you have several problems. first , you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary . oh , so now what are dictionaries for ? second , it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the dictionary . duh . as a scientist , whose technical terms are very often not found in common dictionaries , i know this . but when a term is common , like hypocrisy , a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source . third , we can exchange ideas if you want , but you come out with this nonsense about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary . it's not nonsense . when people read what you write , they have to try to associate a meaning to those words . dictionaries give the meanings of words , don not they ? now , i assume that you would like to have the words you use mean what you would like them to . but the fact is , you are using very different meanings than are in the dictionary , or you would like the reader to assign them new meanings , which they never had . it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others . sad . not at all . what i cannot abide is utter bombast when you have been proven completely wrong . if your facts at all resembled even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be believable .  if you did not put words in my mouth , it might be that you might start reading what i had actually said . i never put even one syllable in your mouth . you have tried to prove this and you failed . so far , you come over and over twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said them . poppycock . in this way , you are answering to yourself . that is why you do not find it believable . maybe , if you start reading what i had actually said , and not what you added , you might change your mind . i read what you said . i did not add anything . you simply either don not know that the words don not mean what you would like them to which cannot be the case now since you have been proven wrong and you quite obviously don not have a defense against the arguments presented , or you are twisting the meanings . which is it ? but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in what you have said on this thread . and the fact also is that you are using different definitions for your words based on baloney than anyone else does .  first , there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what i said , as if i had said it . ha ! there's nothing resembling fact in what you have said . i never added anything to what you said .  how sad to see a model of decorum and tranquillity become like any other sport a battleground for rival ideologies to slug it out with glee . tim rice , chess eric s . perlman center for astrophysics and space astronomy , university of colorado , boulder

3			computer	secrecy	freedom			 an open letter to mr. clinton i m quite astonished , shocked , and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging american freedoms. the clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography . to do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech , and is blatantly unconstitutional . perhaps we should rename this year 1984 in honor of such an illustrious proposal . let the crappy chip live in infamy , and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure . imho , encryption is also protected under the second amendment of the constitution of the united states . i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures . the u.s. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this , and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal . the administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public , and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty . i am not surprised that this administration is doing this . i could have told you so . cryptography is neutral technology . if everybody has strong cryptography including policemen , bureacrats , businessmen , housewives , thugs and hoodlums , we have a sustainable equilibrium . anything less is an unworkable anti egaltarian arrangement , intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms , and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality . we don not need to compromise on issues of freedom . privacy has always been something that has the effect of restricting out ability to prosecute criminals . we are supposed to have the presumption of innocence . i have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my door , and the police may not come in . if i perform a crim in my home , they will have to find out by means other than simply looking . encryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home . simple enough ? for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting americans . and yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie to them about promising to fix things . the administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone , esp . on this issue . the government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications . law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon ; they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it . you mean they might have to go back to actually working to do their job ? oh heavens . no such laws can be constitutionally sound , and this is equivalent to a veiled threat , which i don not appreciate . this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism . i will trade threats for threats , and violation for violation . perhaps the first amendment . definitely the second and fifth . if the administration did say this , it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential , established , entrenched , and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees . the administration would have no legal standing whatsoever ; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal , and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population . unfortunately , the vast segments of the population are misinformed . they just haven not appended sr to the name of out country , yet . this is an outright dingaling denning lie . the two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible , and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise . americans are about to discover ways , through the use of technology , to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government . i seriously doubt that the nsa thinks that privacy and surveillance are compatible . i doubt of any smart person in any other agency thinks so , either . the problem is that they simply hold privacy to be of no value at all .  phil howard , ka9wgn spell protection ? 1 911 a1 right wing conservative capitalists are out to separate you from your money left wing liberal do gooders are out to separate you from everything else !

2			politics	america			 moe berg npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy name possibly garbled by me , an official historian for the cia . she has won an emmy for research on moe berg for a tv documentary which i know from nothing but which sounds good . she said that among other things , berg was the principal spy for the oss cia's wwii precursor spying on axis atomic programs , because of his physics background and language skills . she said that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland , and had instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb research he concluded they were two years behind , and didn not shoot him . i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb program , but i don not know how reliable this is . unfortunately , npr didn not mention any kind of a book she's writing i would certainly buy it . in case you are wondering about baseball relevance , berg was a longtime mlb backup catcher . he was a member of an mlb all star team that toured japan in 1934 , presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few americans , much less mlb players , who spoke japanese . photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids , according to mccarthy . dave mb

3			immunity	secrecy	hacking	encryption			 secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow whatever . hmm . after reading the debate over the clipper , i have a few things to add . first , most of the people i know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate , and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the us . all they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not . that , after all is the bottom line . second , if i look at all the people i know who use any form of encryption at all , and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the des is a good and secure standard , to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies , i can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse . the clipper does this , because people make mistakes by nature , and the us government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else . third , since most of the people i know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies , i can not see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the clipper chip . that despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it . so , i can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip . fourth , when it comes to criminal abuse , sure there are many stupid people out there . and yes , some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the clipper chip . however , anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and , i would assume , start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption . if nothing else were avalible , none of this would be an issue . however , the truth is that most private encryption users that i have ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of rsa or pgp or anything else . if it works , they use it . this is not going to change either . i do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the clipper chip . it is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is , if anything , the clipper chip just adds another tool to the user . the bottom line here is that people will use what works , and unavoidibly , i m sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy . the other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag or if you have an interest in snooping , pandora's box has been opened , and this is not going to change . i have seen a blindness to this that i have found utterly stunning , and the clipper chip , along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree . sincerly , tim scanlon

5			controversy	gender	homosexuality	shakespeare			 arsenokoitai 4 continuing part 4 i think ; used by permission , the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai , with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b . deyoung w . petersen more recently wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction . in a brief 1986 study william petersen found linguistic confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of arsenokoitai . 22 he faulted wright and english bible translaions for rendering it by homosexuals in i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 . in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey , boswell , and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates , in effect , the position of bailey . he finds homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic . a major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul's time 187 88 . what is this disjunction ? he bases it on historical and linguistic facts . accordingly , ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts . virtually all forms of behavior , except transvestism , were acceptable . christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in describing these actions . ancient society know nothing of the categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals , and assumed that , in the words of dover quoted approvingly by petersen , everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli . 188 . 23 in contrast to this , modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual to desire and propensity . k . m . benkert , who in 1869 coined the german term equivalent to homosexual , used it as referring to orientation , impluse or affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts 189 . petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english dictionary , which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts . petersen's point is that by using homosexuals for arsenokoitai , one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history where no equivalent concept existed 189 . consequently the translation is inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles , . incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . and incorrectly includes female homosexuals 19 89 . prior to 1869 there was no cognitive structure , either inour society or in antiquity , within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence 189 . the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio homosexual is mistaken . yet is it possible that petersen is the one mistaken , on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds ? the next phases of this paper will critically examine petersen's position . the justification for translating arsenokoitai by homosexuals historical grounds a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence . since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul's usage , no historical settings earlier than his are available . yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul . the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality , particularly homosexual orientation , in a way similar to present day concepts . peterson , bailey , boswell , and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition , desire , propensity , or inversion whatever it is called cannot be part of the definition of the term . they assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind boswell , active male prostitutes ; scroggs , pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times bailey ; petersen . the following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate . attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds . in regard to the latter position , one may rightfully ask , did not the homosexual condition exist before 1869 ? is it only a modern phenomenon ? yet if it is universal , as alleged today , it must have existed always including ancient times , even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it . indeed , evidence show that the ancients , pre christian and christian , not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior , including all forms of same sex activity transvestism included , but also knoew about same sex orientation or condition . petersen admits 190 n . 10 that plato in symposium 189d 192d may be a sole possible exception to ancient ingnorance of this condition . he discounts this , however , believing that even here acts appear to be the deciding factor . however , this is a very significant exception , hardly worthy of being called an exception , because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition . the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition . 24 plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile female androgynon man woman . hence original nature palai physis , consisted of three kinds of human beings . zeus sliced these human beings in half , to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods . consequently each person seeks his or her other half , either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex . plato then quotes aristophances each of us , then , is but a tally of a man , since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two ; and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him . all the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man woman are woman courters ; our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex , whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses . all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men they are incllined rather to women , and of this stock are the she minions . men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine , and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men's embrasces ; these are the finest boys and striplings , for they have the most manly nature . some say they are shameless creatures , but falsely for their behavior is due not to shamelessness their like . sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men . so when they come to man's estate they are boy lovers , and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom ; they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days . a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man , eagerly greeting his own kind . well , when one of them whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort happens on his own particular half , the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love , and are hardly to be induced to leave each other's side for a single moment . these are they who continue together throughout life , though they could not even say what they would have of one another 191d 192c 25 should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live , or even in hades , aristophanes says that each would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time 192e . several observations about this text are in order . lesbianism is contemplated , as will as male homosexuality 191e . natural interest ton noun physei , 192b refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination . the words , born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai , 192b reflect the modern claims to be born this , i.e . as homosexual . the idea of mutuallity the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love , 192b is present . aristophanes even speaks of mutual love ingrained in mankind reassembling our early estate ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus , 191d . the concept of permanency these are they who continue together throughout life , 102c is also present . further mention of and or allusion to permanecy , mutality , gay pride , pederasty , homophobia , motive , desire , passion , and the nature of love and its works is recognizable . clearly the ancients thought of love homosexual or other apart from actions . the speakers in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial ; money , office , influence , etc . bring reproach 182e 183a , 184b . they mention the need to love the soul not the body 183e . there are tow kinds of love in the body 186b and each has its desire and passion 186b d . the speakers discuss the principles or matters of love 187c , the desires of love 192c and being males by nature 193c . noteworthy is the speech of socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects 200a 201c . desire is felt for what is not provided or present ; for something they have not or are not or lack . this is the object of desire and love . socrates clearly distinguishes between what sort of being is love and the works of love 201e . this ancient philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature . his wors have significance for more than pederasty . 26 in summary , virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato . petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts , not inclination or orientation . widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter . 27 biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction . in rom 1 21 28 such phrases as reasoning , heart , becoming foolish , desires of the heart . and reprobate mind prove paul's concern for disposition and inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv . 29 32 . even the catologues of vices are introdiced i tim 1 8 10 or concluded i cor 6 9 11 by words describing what people are or were , not what they do . habits betray what people are within , as also the lord jesus taught cf matt . 23 28 . the inner condition is as important as the outer act ; one gives rise to the other cf mt 5 27 . petersen errs regarding other particulars too . transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients . it was practiced among canaaniteds , syrian , people of asia minor , as well as greeks , according to s . r . driver . 28 only a few moralist and jewish writers are on record as condemning it . for example , seneca moral epistles 47 . 7 8 condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress , be beardless , and behave as a woman . philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women the special laws iii , 37 41 ; see also his on the virtues , 20 21 , where he justifies prohibition of cross dressing . even the ot forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes deut 22 5 . petersen is also wrong in attributing to christianity the creating of the new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior . these did not begin with paul rom 1 26 27 but go as far back as ancient greece and even non christian contemporaries used them . plato , the testnaph . philo , josephu , plutarch , and others used these words or related concepts . 29 linguistic grounds footnotes  22 w . l . petersen , can arsenokoitai be translated by homosexuals ? i cor 6 9 ;

the latter should be outlawed 181d e . such love of youths is to be permanent 181d , lifelong and abiding 184a . where homosexual love is considered a disgrace , such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the cowardice of the ruled 182d an early charge of homophobia ? in athens it was more honorable to love openly than in secret 182d an ancient expression of coming out of the closet . mutality was present this compels lover and beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue , 184b . for petersen to label the symposium a possible exception to his position is inadequate and misrepresentative . it is a significant witness to greek society hundreds of years before the time of christ 27 dover homosexuality 12 , 60 68 finds homosexual desire and orientation in plato's works symposioum and phaedrus and elsewhere . philo writes of those who habituate themselves to the practive of homosexual acts the special laws 3 . 37 42 ;

1			computer	math	creativity			 tiff philosophical significance of 42 why not use the pd c library for reading writing tiff files ? it took me a good 20 minutes to start using them in your own app . i certainly do use it whenever i have to do tiff , and it usually works very well . that's not my point . i m philosophically opposed to it because of its complexity . this complexity has led to some programs poor tiff writers making some very bizarre files , other programs inability to load tiff images though they will save them , of course , and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand tiff . as the saying goes , it's not me i m worried about it's all the other assholes out there ! i have had big trouble with misuse and abuse of tiff over the years , and i chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format . in the words of the tiff 5 . 0 spec , appendix g , page g 1 capitalized emphasis mine the only problem with this sort of success is that tiff was designed to be powerful and flexible , at the expense of simplicity . it takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification probably no application does a complete job , and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be able to import any tiff image , since there are so many image generating applications out there now . if a program or worse all applications can not read every tiff image , that means there are some it won not some that i might have to deal with . why would i want my images to be trapped in that format ? i don not and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not that anyone does , of course ! ab

4			election	politics	democracy	voting	equality			 freedom of association from article , by paul bartholomew a very well put together post i disagree with several key points , but the post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse i agree wholeheartedly . paul , you have handled this so well , i think that you could write ballot materials . thank you . i would hoped to avoid the rancor that has characterized much of the debate on this issue . i m also not going to prolong the debate on this . i wanted to respond to a couple of the points you make , but this will be my last posting on this . no , don not stop ! right to equal opportunity lets call it reo involves coercion in all cases by definition . one question is it your position that there is no reo ? or just that this is a lesser right to foa ? good question . it just depends . how's that for an answer ? seriously , i believe that it depends on wether or not you are talking about a governmental employer or not . in this case , i believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination , direct or indirect , period . i feel this way not because it would offend my moral sensibilities which it of course would , but because the government is a coercive entity which we cannot escape . it boggles my mind that in my lifetime , there were whites only drinking fountains in some parks , but no fountains for others , yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains certainly were not applied to whites only . in essence , we cannot escape the coercive state . even randy weavers have to pay property tax . on the other hand , private employers are not a monopoly , and their businesses should be run by them , and not by the government , unless they elect to turn their affairs over to that government . why ? says who ? why can mom & pop have foa , but ibm be forced , and force is the correct word here , to have reo ? in the case of the mom & pop store , their foa is directly affected . they , as individuals , will have to associate with whomever they hire . in the case of ibm , i ask again , whose foa are we protecting ? i do not accept that ibm , as a corporate entity , has a right to foa . but if the mom & pop store is affected by who they hire , isn not ibm ? there is a slippery slope here . in santa cruz where a number of loony anti discrimination laws exist , a guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had every imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe , and his tatoos were very distracting . suddenly , by arm waving , by magic , a landlord does not have foa . and on what basis does the foa of the landlord disappear ? it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice . on the basis that the landlord has no contact with his her tenants . if the landlord doesn not associate with his tenants , then how can he complain that his foa is being violated ? i have a lot of interaction all positive with my tenants , so i guess that that isn not an issue . but say i were to buy a unit in another town , and have it managed by a third party . let's say that i have a real aversion to christians because of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker , and because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected . i don not want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window of a house that i own . should the government intervene ? if i was elie weizel and the only rental applicant was tom metzger , should i be forced to rent this distant unit to him ? the companies on the fortune 500 , for example , are all privately owned . they can give you a list of all of their owners . they have no anonymous , unknown to them , owners . publicly owned in the sense that their stock is publicly traded and that the shares of stock are owned by a generic , and ever changing public . yes , and the neat thing about this is that unlike the mom & pop store , you and i can buy shares in ibm , and have influence over their decision making policies if we don not like them . anyway , paul , keep up the good work .  mark walsh walsh optilink uucp uunet ! optilink ! walsh amateur radio km6xu wx3k aol uscf l10861 what , me worry ? william m . gaines , 1922 1992 i m gonna crush you ! andre the giant , 1946 1993

4			politics	war	jew			 legality of the jewish purchase was re israeli expansion lust sam zbib writes i m surprised that you don not consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs , for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state , as a hostile action leading to war .  it was for the purpose of establishing a state , not an exclusive state . if the state was to be exclusive , it would not have 400 000 arab citizens .  could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed .   and no , i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action . when someone wants to buy land , and someone else is willing to sell it , at a mutually agreeable price , then that is commerce . it is not a hostile action leading to war .  no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity . palestinians are no exception . perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business world .  since we are debating the legality of a commercial and ethics of such transactions . basic anti trust law says that , while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing , you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm . you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori . clearly , the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs , they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate . they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews .  the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality . being a multi ethnic multi religious society , accepting the jews as neighbours was no different , just another religion . plus they paid fair market value , etc . they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy . i m not a conspiracy theorist myself , but this one is hard to dismiss .  right now , i m just going to address this point . when the jewish national fund bought most of its land , it didn not buy it from the palestinians themselves , because , for the most part , they were tenant farmers fallahin , living on land owned by wealthy arabs in syria and lebanon . the jnf offered a premium deal , so the owners took advantage of it . it's called commerce . the owners , however , made no provisions for those who had worked for them , basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them . they are to blame , not the jews .  adam shostack   sam zbib bell northern research  bitnet internet voice 613 763 5889 fax 613 763 2626 surface mail stop 162 , pobox 3511 , station c , ottawa , canada , k1y 4h7  my opinions are my own and no one else's amir

4			religion	greed	democracy	god			 clinton joins list of genocidal socialist leaders  people like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths who aren not deserved of it . get a life and chill on the paranoia .   i don not care about cults . there's no language problem here . my problem is with religious fanatics claiming to be god is just a little bit unsettling stockpiling several years supply of canned foods no crime here . and enough weapons to hold off a company no crime here . not to mention the atf , which & ed up in the first place and talking about how they are going to take care of all of the unbelievers . no crime here . also no substantiation of your claim that koresh said this . i for one have never heard this mentioned before . where did you hear it ? but granted , up to that moment , he would done nothing wrong . i recognize and respect that . up to which moment ? the one where you decided that anyone who claims to be god no longer has the protection of the constitution ? what happened to the separation of church and state ? then the atf discovers he doesn not have proper permits for some of his purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them . i have yet to see any evidence of this , either . from what i hear the original warrant the reason for the feb . raid is still sealed . what are unsealed seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid . then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child abuse be refiled . there have been interviews with some parents whose children were in the compound at some point . funny , i haven not seen any of these interviews . interesting that when the social services agencies investigated koresh on these previous charges , they found absolutely no evidence of abuse . these parents claimed psychological and sexual abuse . the childrens statements supported these charges . funny , i don not remember hearing anything about childrens statements , either . where did you say you heard all this ? what i heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse , physical or mental . this from the newspaper and national tv news . did you also hear that it's the job of the batf and the fbi to lay siege to homes where child abuse is suspected ? i thought you did . was it a no knock ? i really haven not heard anything on that . but clearly he was not just another guy minding his own business . clearly ? please tell us what koresh was doing that can be construed as other than minding his own business before the batf raided the place . hell , give them all the guns in the world if they don not bother anyone . but he was a scary sort , don not you think ? the sort of person you would want your daughter to date ? i didn not think so . reason number one to doubt the legal statements made by some of the survivors . your logic just amazes me . i think your grandparents who died in auschwitz would be turning over in their graves if they could hear how cavalierly you throw away people's protection of law because you think they are scary and not the sort of person you would want your daughter to date . what sort of people do you suppose the nazis thought your grandparents were ? probably not the sort they would want their little frauleins dating . note that some of them were made by his guard , well hesitate to say expertly trained killers . and next i suppose you will tell us exactly who these well trained killers have killed ? then he fired on the atf . that's not just a little mistake , or some red white and blue american defending his home against big brother . that shit doesn not fly . because you said so , right ? right . anyone with his background that will shoot and kill federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support . so someone with a different background , say someone who didn not claim to be the messiah , in your book could shoot and kill federal law enforcement officials would be a good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support ? he's a loose cannon . just my opinion . worth the paper it's printed on . you are amazing , simply amazing . joe
1			electronics	electricity	energy	safety	charging	lithium			 what happens if you completely flatten your pb's battery ? can running a powerbook's battery completely flat have any detrimental side effects other than the pb not going i ask ,  only two things i can think of . 1 . although nicad 145 , 145 , 160 , 165c , 170 , 180 batteries should be completely discharged about once a month , leadacid batteries 100 shouldn not ever be completely discharged well , maybe once in a while is okay .  this is a very common mis conception dealing with ni cad batteries . it is a good idea to completely discharge a ni cad cell periodically . it is not a good idea to completely discharge a ni cad battery . the difference being that a cell is only one cell nicad puts out 1 . 2 volts like a rechargeable aaa , aa , c , or d . a battery is defined as more than one cell 9 volt , or 7 . 2 for nicad equivalent . due to differences in the individual cells of a battery , complete discharge can actually harm a nicad battery more than help it overcome the memory effect . the most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop internal shorts , which will weaken other cells that are connected to it , thus reducing the lifespan of your battery pack .  etc . okay , naive question how does one discharge a cell without discharging the entire battery ?

4			motorcycle	gun			 my gun is like my american express card deleted and as far as fully automatic weapons , you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim at .  what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion . in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs . gang members . of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time ? of course they don not and that's the point i was trying to make . every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in . the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers . not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you are a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi auto handguns you are going to be at a disadvantage even with training . i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing shooting . they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren not doing too badly either . the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police . it seems most state cops are . every city and suburban police officer i have seen around the twin cities in the last two years has carried a semi auto of some type different brands though i haven not seen any glock's . with regard to this discussion we are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t . p . g , and close to the realm of r . g , but i would like to put my two cents worth in . while there's nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s&w in . 357 magnum my favorite there are valid advantages to semi autos . i suggest reading massad ayoob's i know , some people can not stand him and think he's full of bull , but i think that in general his material is very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in police work or something like that . he defines a number of ways that semi auto's are different , and that different is good . the main advantage is not in increased firepower , but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode . there is also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn . this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi autos , but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun .  define armed better . go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt . 45 . does one fires faster than the other ? nope . aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable . sure it makes the other guys duck for cover , but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose mode . this is why the military is limiting it's m 16 now to 3 round burst fire . simple semi auto would be better , but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful .  a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber .  a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again . a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first , but will fire merely by pulling the trigger . yes , but this is best done with a two hand hold . with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock , or must fire double action . the da semi auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot . a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round . i m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point . in a da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round an advantage you don not have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discussing this point now . this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation ? granted it's very rare , but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go . slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time . a revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety , but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion , even one handed . actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended . a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off . speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos . can be faster depending on users . the best speedloader users , especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast a problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed . this means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun , with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time . you also don not have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be used if needed later .  a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first , time spent which can be fatal . and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey , it's jammed ! before starting to do anything about clearing it . yes , the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it . really though , in either a revolver or semi auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small . you are more likely to get a jam in a semi auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs , glocks , et . al . most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer . some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked , but a safety engaged . i do not consider this safe however . you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver . there are some double action semi autos out there , but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training . all common semi auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems. while i put that out as a statement that i believe , i should say that this applies to all of the ones i have looked at . for the da semi's it's no different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks . they also have a safety . because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver , plus the advantage of sa followup shots . i m not familiar with sa semi autos except for the 1911 a1 . i admit that i was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked , but after examining the design , trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course , and shooting it a lot , i see no inherent safety problems with it , especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer . this design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver .  some police departments switched to glocks , and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers . too many were having accidents , partly due to the poor training they received . not that glocks require rocket scientists , but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr . yeah , the infamous glock . i still can not figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety . if you don not pull the trigger it doesn not go off . i imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it . in addition , if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you would have problems when the hammer wasn not there .  anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don not know nothing about firearms. turn off cops and hunter and pay attention . i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid . a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot . i think this is even okay for a riot as long as it's a small one b .  gun control is hitting what you aim at . if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don not hit anything . good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit . i own a 9mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver . if i haven not hit what i m aiming at in the first 5 shots , something is quite seriously wrong somewheres . while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases , overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5 . i have the poor man's beretta taurus 99 and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the springfield . 45 oops , 9mm vs . 45 arguments are relegated to r . g . you are right , though . if you don not hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination has failed . i don not ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun . this is a shooter failure , whether through lack of discipline or lack of training .  what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime ? why the same nice simple . 38 revolvers that the police often use . well actually some police prefer the much heftier . 357 magnum , but anyway . 9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too , though the . 38 does still lead the list and like i said , around here semi auto's seem the rule for the street cop . don not know about the state patrol however , they may still carry the highway patrolman .  obplea don not flame me , i prefer semi autos for most things . but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal . vincent , please don not take any of this as a flame . just my $ 0 . 02 whoops , looks more like $ 2 . 00 worth . and much of it is imho , but do check ayoob's book .   if everything had gone as planned , everything would have been perfect . batf spokesperson on cnn 3 2 93 , regarding failed raid attempt in tx .

5			faith	religion	theology	catholicism	controversy	heresy	god			 sspx schism ? larry l . overacker writes , responding to simon i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net . my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicated . but that's really beside the point . what does the roman catholic church say ? excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication , as provided for in canon law . here's some of the theology involved for the interested . there is confusion over this issue of the sspx's schism ; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classifications of obedience first there are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes 1 a command 2 the response made to the command as far as the command goes , commands can be legitimate , such as the pope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays . or they can be illegitimate , such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around . as far as the response to a command goes , it can be to refuse to do what is commanded , or to comply . making a table , there are thus 4 possibilites command response name  legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from . obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal . the nature of the commands must also be taken into account ; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient . you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad . in my example , if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god dagon , and they all refuse , they aren not being disobedient at all ! as far as the society of saint pius x goes , they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires . but that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient . you also have to consider the nature of the papal desires . and there's the rub sspx says the popes since vatican ii have been commanding certain very bad things for the church . the popes have of course disagreed . so where are we ? are we in another arian heresy , complete with weak popes ? or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers ? well , the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what , and what the traditional teaching of the church is . the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on , and what the issues are . the religion of american catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth . you will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press in this country . on the other hand , one italian catholic magazine i get 30 days has had interviews with the superior general of the society of saint pius x . many catholics will decide to side with the pope . there is some soundness in this , because the papacy is infallible , so eventually some pope will straighten all this out . but , on the other hand , there is also unsoundness in this , in that , in the short term , the popes may indeed be wrong , and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they are wrong . in fact , if the situation is grave enough , they sin in obeying him . at the very least , they are wasting a great opportunity , because they are failing to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly . schism . let's move on to schism . what is it ? schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command . all schismatics are disobedient . but it's a superset , so it doesn not work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics . the mere fact that the sspx priests don not comply with the holy father's desires doesn not make them schismatics . so what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism ? maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics . you must add this the rejection of the right to command . look in any decent reference on catholic theology , and that's what you will find the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command . here's what the catholic encyclopedia says , for example . not every disobedience is a schism ; in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors , denial of their divine right to command . from the ce article schism is the society of saint pius x then schismatic ? the answer is a clear no they say that the pope is their boss . they pray for him every day . and that's all that matters as far as schism goes . what all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections , their position is a legitimate one , as far as the catholic theology of obedience and schism goes . they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the papacy , and the best interests of the church . in fact , someone who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist now , what is the stance of rome on all this ? well , if you read the holy father's motu proprio ecclesia dei , you can find out . it's the definitive document on the subject . a motu proprio is a specifically papal act . it's not the product of a roman congregation , a letter that the pope has possibly never even read . it's from the pope himself . his boss is god . there's no one else to complain to . in this document , the holy father says , among other things 1 the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvre constituted a schismatic act . 2 archbishop lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of tradtion . both are confusing i fail to see the logic of the pope's points . as far as the episcopal consecrations go , i read an interesting article in a translation of the italian magazine si si no no . it all gets back to the question of jurisdiction . if episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the pope's jurisdiction , then they would truly constitute a schismatic act , justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law . but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders , episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction . it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments . jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope . the society bishops , knowing the traditional theology quite well , take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone . they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop . the si si no no article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novel , post vatican ii idea of holy orders . according to this idea , episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction . i lent the article to a friend , unfortunately , so can not tell you more . i believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea . the pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me . there's no way there is a schism , according to traditional catholic theology . so why does the pope think this ? as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes , here's the passage in question the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion . incomplete , because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition , which , as the second vatican council clearly taught , comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the help of the holy spirit . there is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on . this comes about in various ways . it comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts . it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience . and it comes from the preaching of those who have received , along with their right of succession in the espiscopate , the sure charism of truth . but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the bishop of rome and the body of bishops . it is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom , in the person of the apostle peter , christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church . papal motu proprio ecclesia dei , 2 july 1988 it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following vatican council ii has happened . i am the pope . the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong , because he disagrees with them . this is weak , to say the least ! it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre's concerns in detail . what is john paul ii's stand on the social kingship of christ , as taught by gregory xvi , pius ix , leo xiii , pius xi and pius xii , for example ? are we supposed to ignore what all these popes said on the subject ? i don not know what the future will hold , but the powers that be in the sspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out .  many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey justified disobedience or even obeying god rather than man . calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice in wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean . similarly , schism indicates a formal break in the church . if the pope says that a schism exists , it seems to me that by definition it exists . it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break , that there is no good reason for the break to exist , and that it will shortly be healed . but how can one deny that it does in fact exist ? it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform the power of the papacy . what good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future , but in the process , you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline ? it's one thing to hold that the pope has misused his powers , and excommunicated someone wrongly . it's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect , and the schism is all in his imagination . that means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools , but acts whose validity is open to debate . generally it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope . while they have often objected to church sanctions , generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist you are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions , claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying , and to be in communion while excommunicated . this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism . clh
2			hockey	football	player	coaching	coach			 joseph and blues shut down warthawks blues up 2 0  one last point , darryl sutter is getting badly out coached by bob berry . the madder darryl gets the more he reminds me of brian . the hawks are quickly loosing thier focus , i don not think the blues will win in 4 but you never know not to sutter bash or anything since i idolized them as players . you sure would think the sutters would learn something about burning out their teams in the regular season . just too much intensity during the regular season . i earlier posted a note about brian and got to thinking after i read this item . gee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the playoffs . kind of makes you wonder . bottom line . man it is great to be smoking the warthawks ! agreed jim . this has been damn sweet , so far . about the only thing that comes close to this is shutting up all the maple laugh fans . detroit has completely kicked their asses so far . but , i will stick with the blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far . stuart esrock bowling green state u . go you blues !
1			animation	software	youtube	linux	video	3d	computer	graphic			 rumours about 3do ? 3do demonstration 3do arm qt compact video and cd i's cpu doesn not help much either . i understand it is a 68070 supposedly a variation of a 68000 68010 running at something like 7mhz . with this speed , you truly need sprites . snip the 3do is not a 68000 !  ricardo , the animation playback to which lawrence was referring in an earlier post is plain old quicktime 1 . 5 with the compact video codec . i have seen digitized video some of apple's early commercials , to be precise running on a centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely 16 bit color depth . i would expect that using the same algorithm , a risc processor should be able to approach full screen full motion animation , though as you have implied , the processor will be taxed more with highly dynamic material . snip booth there . i walked by , and they were showing real time video capture using a radious or supermac ? card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies . i think the quicktime they were using was the old one 1 . 5 .  they digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something . it played back quite nicely and in real time . the guy then expanded the window resized to 25x by 3xx 320 in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn not 30fps or about 30fps anymore . it dropped to like 15 fps . then he increased it just a bit more , and it dropped to 10 12 fps .  then i asked him what mac he was using . he was using a quadra don not know what model , 900 ? to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii .  well , i spoiled his claim so to say , since a 68040 quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble . and this wasn not even from the hardisk ! this was from memory !  could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime , or some hardware assisted centris , or another software product running the animation like supposedly macromind's accelerator ?  don not misunderstand me , i just want to clarify this .  the 3do box is based on an arm risc processor , one or two custom graphics chips , a dsp , a double speed cdrom , and 2mb of ram vram . i m a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and ram vram capacity . it was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the electronic cafe in santa monica , ca . from 3do , rj mical of amiga lynx fame and hal josephson sp ? were there to talk about the machine and their plan . we got to see the unit displaying full screen movies using the compactvideo codec which was nice , very little blockiness showing clips from jaws and backdraft . and a very high frame rate to boot like 30fps . note however that the 3do's screen resolution is 320x240 . compactvideo is pretty amazing . i also wanted to point out that quicktime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above . i m sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine i have a q950 and do this quite a bit . the price of generality . personally i don not use the dynamic sizing of movies often , if ever . but playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines . i m not sure how a centris 20mhz 040 stacks up against the 25 mhz arm in the 3do box . obviously the arm is faster , but how much ? rob barris quicksilver software incorporation

3			genetics	diabetes	cancer	autism	sensitivity			 is msg sensitivity superstition ?  is there such a thing as msg monosodium glutamate sensitivity ? i saw in the ny times sunday that scientists have testified before an fda advisory panel that complaints about msg sensitivity are superstition . anybody here have experience to the contrary ?  i m old enough to remember that the issue has come up at least a couple of times since the 1960s . then it was called the chinese restaurant syndrome because chinese cuisine has always used it .  so far , i have seen about a dozen posts of anecdotal evidence , but no facts . i suspect there is a strong psychological effect at work here . does anyone have results from a scientific study using double blind trials ?  check out 27903 , just some 20 posts before your own . maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses ? yet again , the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of .  for cites on msg , look up almost anything by john w . olney , a toxicologist who has studied the effects of msg on the brain and on development . it is undisputed in the literature that msg is an excitotoxic food additive , and that its major constituent , glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain humans included . too much in the diet , and the system gets thrown off . glutamate and aspartate , also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , and are freely available in many foods , but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food . by eating lots of junk food , packaged soups , and diet soft drinks , it is possible to jack your blood levels so high , that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous real physi9logical effects . read olney's review paper in prog . brain res , 1988 , and check his sources . they are impecable . there is no dispute .  dianne murray in order to excitotoxin effects of msg , msg that in blood must go through blood brain barrier that i am not sure msg can go through or not . in normal condition , the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 2 um that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor the nmda receptor . but the question is neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into neuron or glial . so no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons . glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system . it is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement , it is alsoinvolved in develpoment , memory and learn it is involved in logn term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning .
5			religion	islam	allah	god	jihad	muslim			 the inimitable rushdie judaism , for one . maddi has confirmed this for one . and again i reiterate that one can easily leave the religion at any time , simply by making a public declaration . if one is too lazy to do that then the religion cannot be held responsible . there are many islamic countries where publically renouncing islam can be quite dangerous . these countries might not , according to you , necessarily be practicing true islam , but the danger still remains ; one cannot blame failure to publically renounce islam on laziness as opposed to a desire to stay alive and well . of course , if you are planning to pull a rushdie then declaring one's leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's other plans . in rushdie's case , the one under discussion , one can . it is tragic that in some islamic countries this is so . there are , however , islamic countries whose constitutions contains statements that islamic law is to be incorporated , e.g. kuwait , where one can freely make such statements without fear . not to mention that it has already been pointed out that rushdie has said in his books that he's not a muslim , and there have surely been enough readers of his books to provide the appropriate number of witnesses . this story has become tiresome . the conditions are clear . if you care to make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made public statements about leaving islam prior to his writing of tsv . if he did make such statements then he should have made that clear rather than trying to rejoin islam or go on talking about his personal feelings . gregg

it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670 , 000 of the 1 , 120 , 000 inhabitants . this impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic , a solid block of 370 , 000 tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia . see also map 1 . historic armenia and map 4 . administrative subdivisions of transcaucasia . in 1920 , 0 percent turk . we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . our troops surrounded village after village . little resistance was offered . our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . some of the tartars escaped of course . they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey . the rest were killed . and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages . they are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . ohanus appressian men are like that p . 202 . in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves . it certainly is possible to severe the artificial life support system of an imagined ethnic purity that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land . sahak melkonian 1920 preserving the armenian purity  daniel dusan chukurov 21324 the world's inaction when the conflict began over the mostly christian armenian enclave inside muslim azerbaijan might have encouraged the conflict in bosnia herzegovina , said the moscow based activist , who's part armenian . no kidding . the armenians tore apart the ottoman empire's eastern provinces , massacred 2 . 5 million defenseless turkish women , children and elderly people , burned thousands of turkish and kurdish villages and exterminated the entire turkish population of the armenian dictatorship between 1914 1920 . such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in armenia brings a depth and verification to the turkish genocide that is hard to match . a hundred years ago armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the russian anarchists that they accepted as role models . several armenian terror groups like asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s , butchering scores of innocent turks and their families in the united states and europe . it seems that they are doing it again , at a different scale , in fascist x soviet armenia today . a merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small azeri town of khojali pop . 6000 in karabagh , azerbaijan , is reported to have taken place on the night of feb . 28 under a coordinated military operation of the 366th mechanized division of the cis army and the armenian insurgents . close to 1000 people are reported to have been massacred . elderly and children were not spared . many were badly beaten and shot at close range . a sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed the azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped armenian insurgency . the neighboring azeri city of aghdam outside of the karabagh region has come under heavy armenian artillery shelling . city hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant were killed . azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its sovereignty . serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ohanus appressian 1919 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . sahak melkonian 1920

4			people	murder			 hallam baker bashes tpgers was re welcome to police state usa   from article , by phill hallam baker just what the hell do you base that ludicrous claim on ? there are plenty of fine , decent people people who read post to t . p . g . if any of these people are paranoid it is because of people like you .  hey dude you are making me paranoid ! what an argument !   while i wouldn not be too terribly impressed with anybody who got to be paranoid based on either usenet in general or phill hallam baker's comments in general , you would be surprised .  for most people , if you accuse them of something long enough and loud enough , to enough people , they start to ask why they are bothering to fight it .  if nothing you do will be considered right , why bother to do right ? it's pretty basic human nature .  i would have a spot of tea with them . you probably gave up on arguing the case for arms control directly long ago because posters who know what they are talking about e.g . frank crary disproved all your arguments for why more gun control is needed . so , you gave up because you know they are right and you couldn not refute their answers .  no , frank crary's arguments are based on the assumption that most people are sane , normal people . tpg disproves this of gun owners .  what an amazing thing . i didn not realize that over a hundred million gun owners all posted to tpg .  even if all the posts in talk . politics . guns illustrated what you say they illustrate , it would still only reflect the written personas which is often different from face to face of a very , very small and select group .  anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on usenet to the general population of any country either doesn not care about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them .  usenet as a whole disproves it of humanity as a whole .  speaking of which .  most of the readership posts i have seen put the most read newsgroups at about 160 , 000 readers , a number i have a feeling is fairly inflated . the posters , rare and regular , are themseleves a very tiny minority of that group . and the whole of usenet readers are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity .  if anything , the only real thing you can get out of the relative sample of usenet readers is that we have got too much equipment and too much time available to us .  we now have proof positive that guns don not make you safer . buy a lot of guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the fbi to burn down your house .  proof that guns don not make you safer is that if you buy one the government will show up and kill you ?  tell me , if the government took away the voting rights of everybody who exercised their free speech , would that then be proof that free speech squelches political activity ?  you are equating two things with each other that don not .  see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons to support gun control .  phill , if you really believe that the various posts on computer nets represents either most of the poster's in person personalities or the general public's general opinions , then i have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality .  but don not expect you really do believe that . it's simply a convenient way to make your point , and hopefully make those people you don not like look bad .  cuddles n kisses  phill  have a nice day , phill .   david veal university of tennessee division of continuing education i still remember the way you laughed when you pushed me down the elevator shaft . sometimes i get to thinking you don not love me anymore . weird al yankovic .

3			module	nasa	system			 ssf redesign constellation decentralize & automate functions space station , constellation ssf is up for redesign again . let's do it right this time ! let's step back and consider the functionality we want 1 microgravity vacuum process research 2 life sciences research adaptation to space 3 spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach , explified by shuttle and ssf so far , was to centralize functionality . these projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it , and ssf has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication . over $ 50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization . meanwhile , military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation . firstly , different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the gps navstar constellation in 12 hour orbits , comsats in clarke and molniya orbits , etc. secondly , the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation , providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed . ssf's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization . 1 we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now comet and mir for long duration flights , shuttle spacelab for short duration flights . the best strategy for this area is inexpensive , incremental improvement installation of u.s. facilities on mir , shuttle mir linkup , and transition from shuttle spacelab to a much less expensive ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet . we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments , eg the high radiation van allen belt or gas plasma gradients in comet tails . the comet system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks , where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond leo . 2 we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity , but also in lunar and martian gravities , and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of leo . this is a very long term , low priority project , since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude . furthermore , using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation , and the sample size . so i propose labratsat , a constellation tether bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super van allen belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on earth moon , earth mars , earth asteroid , etc. trips . the miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real time from earth thru a vr interface . after several orbital missions have been flown , follow ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface , testing out the actual environment at low cost before $ billions are spent on astronauts . 3 by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in clarke orbit . i propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills . once in place , robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas , attach solar battery power packs , inject fuel , etc. once the fleet is working , it can be spun off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards . by applying the successful constellation strategy , and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf , we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost for a fraction of ssf's pricetag , we can fix satellites where the satellites are , we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments , and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and , if needed , in special purpose orbits . n . b . we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well , greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality . mars network and artemis are two good examples of this ; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used to fuel planet wide rover ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return . the descendants of labratsat's technology can be used as a mars surface ldef and to test out closed ecology greenhouses on mars at low cost  nick szabo
3			gas	fluid			 abyss breathing fluids besides the mechanical problems of moving so dense a medium in oan out of the lungs diaphragm fatigue , etc . is there likely to be a problem with the mixture ? i mean , since the lungs never expel all the air in them , the inhaled air has to mix pretty quickly with the residual air in the lungs to provide a useful partial pressure of oxygen , right ? would this mixing be substantially faster slower at the pressures we are talking about ? there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago about breathing liquid . it was a few months before the abyss came out . as far as i can remember , they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid low viscosity if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out of the lungs , you can not extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort let alone anything else diffusion rate obviously , not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out ; and the part that isn not expelled is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli . alveolus ? so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid . apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than co2 , so even if you can get enough oxygen in , you might not be able to get enough co2 out . oxygen co2 capacity you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume . oh , and of course , your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that .  wim lewis ,

5			violence	morality	politics	ethic	democracy			 questioning authority despite my trendy , liberal , feminist tendencies and the fact that i basically agree with what you are saying i will rebut for all those people who insist i question authority why ? . authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things . people who just follow orders have tortured and killed others in very large numbers , and protest their innocence afterwards .  the basic question here is how do i know what i am supposed to do ? this is true in every situation that comes up . some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses . i claim that is just as dangerous as following authority . i could site sexually transmitted diseases , drug abuse , all manner of criminal activity , the savings and loan scandal , car accidents , eggs thrown at my house , all are examples of people not following authority . i could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the problem was a leader not following his authority and doing what he wanted . of course , where is the top of the chain ? therein lies our search .  when your authority starts telling you to do things , you should ask questions . except for situations of pressing need i said shut the hatch because the submarine is filling with water ! any reasonable authority should be able to give at least some justification that you can understand . i don not think it's as simple as you are claiming . pressing need is ambiguous . should i recycle or not ?  realize that i have four kids who , despite being very precocious of course , are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge i wish to impart to them . just be sure to listen when authority answers . ahh ! an ironic ending .  the irony i was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper sticker cliche question authority was that i was questioning the authority of the person telling me to question authority . it seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different , only in rebelling , forsaking everything for the sake of freedom . i question their integrity and fortitude . there is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly . different people are at different levels of development in different areas . part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow , we can not know everything about everything . often when learning a new skill or subject i will follow the teacher , perhaps blindly . only when i have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should i question him , only when i have developed my skills enough should i challenge him . once again , how do i know when i get to those stages ? if you have to be told to question authority , perhaps you shouldn not . chris mussack a good comedian should never have to explain his jokes .

5			satan	jesus	faith	religion	christianity	christ	god			 is it good that jesus died ?  so what is your beef against jesus ? first and foremost , i honestly do not believe that jesus was anything more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago . i know your bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did , but i simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it , and i similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed . period . i view religion in general and christianity in specific as a cultural virus that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate , so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths , and it goes on from there . and eventually christianity becomes a given if so many other people believe in it , it must be right , no ? i don not believe in any life after death . i believe that when i die , i die , so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime . i don not believe that it's a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin pride , in moderation , is a constructive thing . i see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women , and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the faults of these opinions to me . i don not believe in loving everyone , especially people i have never met ; while i try to show respect to everyone , my love and admiration is something not easily earned , and i do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it . if you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously , stop trying to show me how the bible makes sense . start trying to show me that this jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone's life here on earth .  brian kendig je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j ai vus ; j ose croire n etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . the meaning of life si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . is that it ends . rousseau

2			cycling	motorcycle	safety	racing	time	speed			 i need your advice ! i m a new rider the tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first 500 miles do not go over 4 , 000 rpm's , and for the next 500 miles , don not go over 6 , 000 . referred to as the break in period if you didn not know .  well , if i were to do that , i would never be going over 35 mph even in 6th gear ! so my question is , will it hurt my new cycle to take it up in the 6 7000 rpm range so that i can at least go the speed limit ? but you already can go at the speed limit at 4000 rpm . all you need to do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit . this isn not quite as silly as it sounds . if you take a nice day trip over back roads not highways full of people trying seriously to get from here to there then you might be able to hold 35 mph comfortably . you could easily do 500 miles over three different weekends . you might even get to enjoy some of the scenery . yes , i know this is probably not why you bought a 250 called ninja . david karr 80 bmw r65 dod 0969 also bmwmoa , nra , aclu , et al .

1			computer	fun			 joystick suggestions ? it depends on what you would like your joystick for . i have seen gravis joysticks at radio shack . they seemed flimsy and didn not fit well in my hand . i have heard on c . s . i . p . games that they don not last well less than a year on flightsims. one redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick . i recently purchased a ch flightstick . there aren not any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick . i m currently using it for the wing commander series and red baron . works quite well . the large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free . the buttons provide good tactile response you can hear and feel them well . there are other models made by ch that can go up or down in features . for price comparison gravis analogue joysticks sell for $ 35 . 00 here compared to the $ 45 . 00 i paid for a ch flightstick . i think the extra $ 10 . 00 is worth it just in feel . best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy . just another note , analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch . if you are only playing games such as castle wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input ie . only up , down , left , etc. instead of how much right you might want to look into a gravis gamepad . they look like a nintendo control pad but i don not know much beyond that .  will christie aatchoo ! philosophy the principles and university of manitoba uh oh . science of thought and reality winnipeg , mb , canada i m leaking philosopher someone who thinks brain lubricant . they are useful to society

2			softball	football	strikeout	baseball	pitcher	rule	pitching			 rule book trivia 2 if i were the manager , i would argue that the runner was out of the base line since he was to the left of the first base line . if the umps don not budge which they won not they nev er admit when they are wrong , i would file a protest with the league .  rule 7 . 09 k states it is interference by a batter or runner when in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base . he runs outside the three foot line , or inside to the left of the foul line and , in the umpire's judgment , interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base .  the key word in the rule is and . a runner isn not out just for running out of the baseline . he's out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batter runner's head , there's no inter ference .    so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw ? the rule book certainly doesn not have a definiton or clarification , so it's possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter runner , then again we have interference . you know , it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly if the catcher or the pitcher , say rob dibble , for example throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline , the fielder takes the chance of being ejected . therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him . you should note that in our american legion league , which uses mlb rules we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference per rule 7 . 09 . rstimets

best i can tell this statement underscores your apparent total ignorance of the subject , and highlights your personal bias against firearms. i say this because there are only two possible paths of gun control which you could have been referencing . either 1 you were talking about their access to semi automatics firearms. in this case i should point out that semi automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this country , including texas and colorado . in addition the members of the cult have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons . so under what grounds would you deny them these guns ? their religion ? the fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves ? because you consider them to be a cult ? maybe i consider your church to be a cult ! this line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of thought crimes . you and pat robertson should really get along . 2 you were referring to the alleged fully automatic weapons possessed by the cult . under current us law , fully automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this nation . so if david koresh illegally possessed them , he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have . how will more laws help ?

5			faith	religion	ethic	skepticism	belief	truth	atheist	god			 why do people become atheists ? of faith if you want to know , i feel that faith is intellectually dishonest .  i would appreciate some support for this statement . i m not sure it really makes sense to me . i define faith as belief , in the abscense sp ? of evidence . i also include in evidence past experiences . because i have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because i have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works i have read and other reasons , i do not believe in any god s . from what i have seen , some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith . it is faith in that sense the only way i currently understand the word faith that i find intellectually dishonest the ambiguity of religious beliefs , an unwillingness to take pascal's wager ,  i have heard this frequently what exactly is pascal's wager ? pascal's wager goes something like this premise 1 either there is or there isn not a god . premise 2 if god exists , he wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing . premise 3 if god does not exist , then belief in god doesn not matter because death is death , anyway . conclusion belief in god is superior to non belief because non belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong , while belief in god only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong . sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound . the problem is , premise 1 presupposes 1 1 odds between belief and non belief . this is flat out wrong , because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that , for the most part , the religions are mutually exclusive . i have heard theists referred to as 99 atheists because they believe in their god or gods to be the one god or set of gods . the consequence of this is what if i pick the wrong god ? suddenly , the odds don not look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god's version of hell . do i sound broken to you ?  i don not know . you point out that your mother's treatment upset you , and see inconsistencies in various religions . i m not sure if that constitutes broken ness or not . it certainly consititutes disillusionment . i don not see how disillusionment enters into it . you see , i presented my mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism , a questioning which continues to this day . i had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother's version of christianity . if anything , i had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism uh , oh , i thought , what if there is a god ? yes , in a way , i have also become disillusioned by many religions , simply because i had thought at one time that they had all the answers , if i only found the right one . i m still looking , but each time i look in a different place , i become a little stronger in my attitude belief , if you will , no faith , though , it's based on the evidence of past experience that i will never find a religion which has all the answers . sorta like looking for easter eggs . the more time it takes you to find the next one , the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you are going to find . someone else mentioned that critisism isn not going to make me think any more highly of christians . i have a contrary position constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards christians . abusive critisism will turn me off . no accusations to you , mr. sapienza . i merely slipped that into this post because i forgot to reply to that one . filipp sapienza department of technology services university of michigan hospitals surgery  muppets and garlic toast forever . max bob muir ps i m leaving for home on thursday at 1 30 , so this is likely my last post here for the summer ! in the meantime , thank you all for helping me see a few more things i might have missed in my meanderings through the world !

1			computer	writing	email			 page setup in notepad x news reader vms news 1 . 20 i often use notepad to view and print read . me type files . i often find myself rushing to get to print manager to stop the printer and delete the file from the print queue because i have forgotten to reset the print margins from . 75 inches left and right to 0 inches . the resulting printed text looks all chopped up because of the hard returns in the source file .  . i struggled with the margin problem for ages as well , until i finally got hold of the shareware binary editor beav133 , and dug into notepad . exe there is no setup facility to force notepad to default to 0 . 0 margins it's hardwired into code ! do a search for . 75 , then change the offending bytes to . 00 , et viola . who are the guys who hardcode these options anyway ? i m interested in whether the problem only rears it's ugly head for certain printers i m using an old epson lx 800 or is that ex 800 ? never can remember . aloha .
2			basketball	espn	sport	football	overtime	baseball			 espn thumbs up your $ ! i think this proves by $ & point . the caps game goes into overtime but due to contractual obligations they have to switch to the fucking baseball . sorry for my language but im pissed ! what the hell were they going to do if their scheduled game went into overtime ? espn get your head out of your ass .  now i know there are a lot hey american hockey fans , as a hockey fan i can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel . the problem is that other americans don not give a shit about hockey . they view it as a bunch of canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in two thirds of the us to see the stuff naturally . on the other hand baseball is the gasp swoon sigh national pasttime . baseball is so romanticized in the us that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after april 1 and before november 1 . i feel that since espn shows 5 baseball games a week they should be able to show an ot hockey game instead of the opening innings of a baseball game . hell , the game is going to last 2hrs 45mins , so what if you miss the first 1 1 2 hrs ? and i am an indians fan ! show the end of what you started , then switch ! but then , i m a hockey fan , what do i know ? baseball is the all mighty sport . jason go whalers ! pick well !

5			america	europe			 the inimitable rushdie  i don not think you are right about germany . my daughter was born there and i don not think she has any german rights eg to vote or live there beyond the rights of all ec citizens . she is a british citizen by virtue of her parentage , but that's not full citizenship . for example , i don not think her children could be british by virtue of her in the same way .  i am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an application for it . it might require immigration to germany , but i am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable in this case . nope , germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws . the ethnic germans who have lived in russia for over 100 years automatically become citizens if they move to germany , but the turks who are now in their third generation in germany can not . it's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent . karl  lastly , i come to china in the hope all you touch and all you see of fulfilling a lifelong ambition is all your life will ever be . dropping acid on the great wall . duke pink floyd  a lie is still a lie even if 3 . 8 billion people believe it .
4			tank	weapon	terrorist	war	hezbollah			 was go hezbollah ! please clarify your standards for rules of engagement . as i understand it , israelis are at all times and under all circumstances fair targets . their opponents are legitimate targets only when mirandized , or some such ?  i m sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant a priori that israelis are the black hats , and that therefore killing them is automatically a good thing go hezbollah ! the corollary is that the hezbollah are the white hats , and that whatever they do is a good thing , and the israelis only prove themselves to be bad guys by attacking them .  this sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan i know , who cheers when one of the players on his team uses his stick to permanently rearrange an opponent's face , and curses the ref for penalizing his side . of course , when it's different when the roles are reversed .  d . c . sessions well , you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the retaliatory shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israeli backed forces . my team , you see , was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands , so to speak . i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda . there are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in retaliation to pin point attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the lebanese terrorists . brad hernlem

4			democracy	war	iraq	kosovo	afghanistan			 europe vs . muslim bosnians  i also understand that the administration is planning to position troops in macedonia . any reaction out there to this ?  macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such forces . this is sort of like sending the national guard to bel air when the riot is in south central ! obviously , clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes in america rather than to try to deal with the real problem and assume a share of responsibility for the problem . he obviously didn not even consult with the macedonians . he was just looking at the map of the former yugoslavia for the safest place to put american troops so he could say to the europeans . hey , look , we have troops on the ground in the former yugoslavia too . now let me bomb so i can make it look like i am doing something in the american media . the problem is that the blue berets in bosnia are dead meat if clinton starts bombing , but clinton doesn not have the courage to ask that the blue berets leave , because then he becomes primarily responsible to the bosnian policy of the un and the allies . clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too . he wants to feel free to use american military power for the sake of domestic us politics and his domestic image , but he doesn not want to assume the primary international leadership role in the un and among the allies , like bush , for all his faults , did in the gulf war . because with leadership comes responsibility , and clinton seems to want to retain the europeans as scapegoats . clinton wants to leave the europeans in charge and responsible , but wants to freelance on the side . and if his freelancing gets too hot , he wants to be able to cut and run . the american public may be easily fooled . european leaders aren not . gerald

3			relativity	mars	physic	satellite	space	gravity	astronomy			 japanese moon landing temporary orbit the gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions . these are described by the inventor as exploiting the second order perturbations in a three body system . the probe was launched into this region for the earth moon sun system , where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down . the idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel , we will just find the trajectory that makes it possible . the originator of the technique said that nasa wasn not interested , but that japan was because their probe was small and couldn not hold a lot of fuel for deceleration . i should probably re post this with another title , so that the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical use of temporary orbits . another possible temporary orbit  phil fraering seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff . like how the ancient mayans had televison . repo man
5			jesus	evil	religion	god			 is it good that jesus died ? and i maintain  some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters , because they fear it ; they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms. and so , by their own choice , they will remain in darkness , sort of like bugs under a rock . however , some people , but not many , will not like the darkness . sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable . these people will crawl out from under the rock , and , although blinded at first , will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth . and , after a while , now that they can see things for what they really are , they will also see the heights which they can reach , and the places they can go , and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world , and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes . are you your own master ? do you have any habits that you cannot break ? for one , you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the bible . seems that ignorance has you mastered . how about sexual sins ? gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of ? do you dehumanize women when they walk past you ? do you degrade them to a sex object in your head ? are you the master of that kind of thinking ? do you insult people unknowingly , then regret it later . yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself ? are you truly the master of yourself ? i have admitted that i am not the master of my thought life at all times . that i sometimes say things i do want to say , and then repeat my mistake unwantingly . i have admitted to myself that i cannot control every aspect of my being . there are times i know i shouldn not say something , but then say it anyway . there are times i simply forget a lesson . i , in fact , am not my own master . i need help . jesus promised me this help . and i took him up on his offer . i have willfully let jesus be my master because jesus knows what is better for me than i myself do . and why not ? does not the creator know his creation better than the creation ? does toyota know what's better for the corolla than the corolla ? do you see my point ? i think you are the one under the rock , and i m getting a great tan out here in the sunlight . my life has improved immesurably since i abandoned theism come and join me ! it will be a difficult trip at first , until you build up your muscles for the long hike , but it's well worth it ! then i guess ignorance is bliss for you . because brian , you enjoy not having a clue about the bible . don not you see ? i m not going to accept anything that i can not witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses , especially not something as mega powerful as what you are trying to get me to accept . surely if you believe in it this strongly , you must have a good reason to , don not you ? can you witness motherly love with your senses ? how does caring and concern for you register with your senses ? if nothing registers to you other than what you can see , taste , smell , hear and touch , then you better become a vulcan and fast you better get rid of your emotions . and i do have a good reason to believe what i do . when did i say that ? i say that i would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whims of a deity , but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who i am , then so be it . the topic was about my god and your lack of knowledge about what my god says . my god says that you will not cease existing . you have life forever . you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever , or can choose to live it in paradise with god . that is what my god says . and that was the issue . your made up theism is what it is made up . it's wishful thinking .  nope most people are christian . most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect , of believing that the world is an undesirable place , of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again , of doing just as their priests tell them , like good little sheep . you enjoy darkness , and you are proud of it . is this the religion of kendigianism ? most people are not christian . most people , including christians , are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect . is the world an undesireable place a doctrine of kendigianism ? it has nothing to do with my god . does kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship ? mine doesn not . does kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again ? mine doesn not . does kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep ? mine doesn not . is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the bible ? brian , following christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of kendigianism . you would find any of your doctrines in the bible . i don not follow kendigianism . i follow christ also , to try to again show you your ignorance of christ and the bible in regards to priests , have you not read about the sole melchizedek priest in hebrews 7 and 8 ? have you not read what the purpose is of the old testament levitical priesthood and why there should not be priests today ? yes , guess what ? the catholics messed up . i do not follow catholicism or any ism . i follow christ nope . you make decisions , enjoy your successes , and accept your failures ; then you die . if you are content with the life you have led as you reflect back on it in your final moments , then you have led a good life . why would you want to live a good life ? to you , you die and that's it . don not contradict yourself . you have no reason to live a good life . it doesn not do you any good in the end . your life doesn not do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway . so you have no reason to lead a good life . leading a good life is meaningless . why do you do such a meaningless thing ? i m sorry , i don not feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god i would worship would do , unless the sacrifice was only temporary , in which case it's not really all that important . has the resurrection sunk in ? jesus is alive . jesus is not dead . jesus was sacrified to fufill the old testament sacrificial system in its every detail . jesus's death was like a seed . he needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root . did you miss the entire john passage as well ?

3			hacking	nsa	espionage	secrecy	encryption			 hearing on 29 april 1993 i received a fax of a letter from representative markey subcommittee on telecommunications and finance to ron brown secretary of commerce . since encryption and the clipper chip are raised in this letter , i felt it would be of interest i understand that on 29 april , mr. markey will be holding a hearing on the questions raised in this letter . there may also be a follow on hearing dedicated to the clipper chip , but that's not definite . i have typed in the letter , which follows . any errors in transcription are mine .  glenn tenney amateur radio aa6er voice 415 574 3420 fax 415 574 0546 letter of interest follows april 19 , 1993 the honorable ronald h . brown secretary department of commerce 14th and pennsylvania ave . nw washington , dc 20236 dear secretary brown as you know , i have long been interested in the privacy and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in a networked environment . recent reports concerning the administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption standard , based upon clipper chip technology , have raised a number of related issues . the international competitiveness of u.s. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is a key factor that the government should consider when addressing issues of encryption and data security . as the nation moves forward in developing the national communications and information infrastructure , security of telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of users . the hacker community can compromise the integrity of telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the network . the people and businesses that use the nation's telecommunications network and the personal computers linked through it increasingly are demanding that information be protected against unauthorized access , alteration , and theft . i am concerned that the administration's plan may mean that to remain competitive internationally , u.s. companies would be compelled to develop two products one for u.s. government customers , and another for private , commercial users who may want a higher encryption standard this may inadvertently increase costs to those u.s. companies hoping to serve both markets . to assist the subcommittee's analysis of this issue , please respond to the following questions 1 . has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the administration been tested by any entity other than nsa , nist or the vendor ? if so , please identify such entities and the nature of testing performed . if not , please describe any plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how such experts will be chosen . 2 . under the administration's plan , what entities will be the holders of the keys to decrypt scrambled data ? what procedures or criteria will the administration utilize to designate such key holders ? 3 . does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the administration contain a trap door or back door , which could allow an agency or entity of the federal government to crack the code ? 4 . it is clear that over time , changes in technologies used for communications will require new techniques and additional equipment . how will encryption devices adapt to the rapid advancement of telecommunications technology ? 5 . what additional costs would the proposed encryption place on the federal government ? what is the estimated cost to consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard in their equipment ? 6 . what is the commerce department's assessment of the competitive impact of the administration's endorsement of the clipper chip technology on u.s. exports of computer and telecommunications hardware and software products ? i would appreciate your response by no later than close of business , wednesday , april 28 , 1993 . if you have any questions , please have your staff contact colin crowell or karen colannino of the subcommittee staff at 202 226 2424 . sincerely , edward j . markey chairman   glenn tenney voice 415 574 3420 fax 415 574 0546 ham radio aa6er
4			america	russia			 kissenger says no ! you are right to notice my assumptions . i should have used bosnian serbs and serbia and bosnian muslims in my post how quaint of you to point this out , and then to completely ignore all of the blatant lies you have trotted out . the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians 78 years ago in eastern anatolia and x soviet armenia is being reenacted again this time in azerbaijan . there are remarkable similarities between the plots , the perpetrators , and the underdogs . blatantly lied and still have not corrected yourself . the goltz article was not published in the sunday times magazine on march 1 , 1992 , but in the guardian sunday section . the story was not filed frim agdam but from london . i will let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits . source not he sunday times , 1 march 1992 a british weekly , written by thomas goltz , from agdam , azerbaijan . armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families . the spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former soviet union gained new impetus yesterday with cold blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war racked nagorno karabakh . survivors reported that armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than 450 azeris , many of them women and children , who were fleeing an attack on their town . hundreds , possibly thousands , were missing and feared dead . the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children . they then turned their guns on the terrified refugees . the few survivors later described what happened that's when the real slaughter began , said azer hajiev , one of three soldiers to survive . the armenians just shot and shot . and then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives . they were shooting , shooting , shooting , echoed rasia aslanova , who arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through in front of her . her daughter was still missing . one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off . the survivors said 2000 others , some of whom had fled separately , were still missing in the gruelling terrain ; many could perish from their wounds or the cold . by late yesterday , 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in agdam's morgue , and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery . of the seven corpses i saw awaiting burial , two were children and three were women , one shot through the chest at point blank range . agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror . doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter , most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds . nor were they safe in agdam . on friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 150 , 000 , destroying several buildings and killing one person . now wait , there is more . it's inhumane to ignore this violence the stories of survivors of karabag massacre 69 year old hatin nine telling my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes . they told me we won not kill you . but the babies have to die in front of your eyes . 72 year old huseyin ibrahimoglu our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours . while killing children and babies mercilessly they said you are turks , you must die . 28 year old gulsum huseyin not hey bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes . are these stories lies ? have the eye witnesses been day dreaming ? were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region ? the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british journalists , too . two days before we had quoted from a sunday times article . they british reported the events in karabag even before turkish journalists . what is more here are the pictures . pictures of people who were bayonetted , whose eyes were gouged , ears cut off . even the armenian radio couldn not claim these lies . they are saying exaggeration . that means 'somethings have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported . perhaps that village of khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours , instead of 2 . or gulsum huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach . the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions . the effects of this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word some of the western press , led by some french newspapers , ability to close their eyes is nothing but complicity in this massacre . yesterday we gave samples from le figaro . until yesterday's print no news about the real events in karabag were printed . so were the french tv channels . the subject they considered related to karabag was not he necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks . the age we are living in is termed a human rights age . there are lots of organizations such as united nations and csce conference on security and cooperation in europe , and rules , all designed to fight against human rights violations . international reactions must be made with international cooperation . with support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized . could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty ? where is the cooperation ? where are the reactions ? and the intellectuals , journalists , writers , tv stations of certain western countries such as france who are fast to claim leadership of human rights ? where are you ? serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ohanus appressian 1919 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . sahak melkonian 1920
5			jesus	religion	christ	hell	god			 atheists and hell imagine the worst depth of despair you have ever encountered , or the worst physical pain you have ever experienced . some people suffer such emotional , physical , and mental anguish in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful . but at least the pain does end in death . what if you lived a hundred such lives , at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another ? what if you lived a million , a billion years in this state ? what if this kept going forever ? did this happen to jesus ? i don not think so , not from what i heard he lived one day of suffering and died . if the wages of sin is the above paragraph , then jesus didn not pay for our sins , did he ? this is something i have always found a little curious . i have never quite understood the trinity thing . on the one hand , jesus is supposed to be god incarnate . but , at the same time , he is god's son for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son . first question is , if jesus was god in human form , how could he really be god's son ? if the holy ghost planted the seed in mary , so to speak , then it seems that jesus relationship to god would be the equivalent to the human father son relationship . while a son might inherit alot of the father's qualities , he is not the father . they are still two separite entities . to try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong . in that case , jesus and god aren not the same . on the other hand , if their relationship isn not the same as the human father son relationship , but jesus is actually god incarnate , then he's not really god's son and he never was . he's just god manifesting himself as jesus . at least , this is how i m seeing it . can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us ? getting back to the original question , what is the great price that jesus paid to redeem our sins ? was it dying on the cross ? since jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven , i have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity . his earthly body may have been killed , but then , so what ? he suffered a few hours of physical pain , but then , there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more . the fact that jesus was god's only begotten son doesn not seem to me to have much meaning since god can beget as many sons as he wants to . jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice . i suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many christians on this net . to those people , please accept my sincere apologies . it is not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ but , i do believe these are legitimate questions and i am genuinely curious .  note that the trinity and incarnation have to be looked at together . first , your reading of the virgin birth is an uncommon one . in this group , it's dangerous to say that no one believes something . you seem to be suggesting the jesus is god's son in a physical sense , with the holy spirit as father and mary as mother . i consider that terrible heresy , though some people react less violently . the virgin birth says that jesus birth is god's responsibility . but it doesn not imply that god's sperm was involved . indeed one though by no means the only speculation is that god used joseph's genetic material . second , jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the father . in a trinitarian context , the term son refers to the eternal logos , who is a part of god . the son didn not come into existence with jesus birth . jesus is the incarnation of the son . so his sonness isn not specifically a result of being incarnated . rather , it's the son who was incarnated . clh

3			science	cancer	nutrition	chemistry			 barbecued foods and health risk   i don not understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the u.s . i think that  no , there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount . this was passed by congress in the 1950's , before stuff like mass spectrometry became available , which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude .  this is why things like cyclamates and red 2 were banned . they are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats , so under the act they are banned .  this also applies to natural carcinogens . some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good , and never tasted so good again . that was the time when safrole was banned . this is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves .  if it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days , someone would do it , in order to make money . the fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect .  an odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file . this is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves . this is not only a natural product , but a natural product still in its natural form , so maybe that's how they evade delany . or maybe a special exemption was made , to appease powerful louisiana democrats .  i think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to commercially produce sell food with carcinogenic substances , it is not illegal for people to do such to their own food smoking , etc . is this true ?
3			fear	violence	war	freedom			 is this overreaction ? . we would like to keep it that way . thats the point . by reacting strongly and forcefully now , we will assure that we continue to remain free . you cannot overreact to a threat like this . the worst that happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort . the worst that happens if we underreact is tyranny . i prefer overreaction myself . . only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom . i suggest that overreacting now and in the future is a good thing . perry is right on target here . careful analysis of the clipper chip announcement reveals that is not likely to remain voluntary for very long . the cost of the system , the cost of generating and then storing the escrow keys , and the admitted security holes pretty much make the clipperphone a loser . strong crypto will outcompete it , if strong crypto is allowed . this is the battle we face . we had rumblings of this totalitarian key registration thing a while back , and now the other shoe has dropped . the firestorm of commentary and criticism this time around reveals the almost immediate revulsion this wiretap chip and automatic caller id and callee id , don not forget ! generates in everyone , or almost everyone , who hears about it . this is a battle we can not afford to lose . tim may  . timothy c . may crypto anarchy encryption , digital money , anonymous networks , digital pseudonyms , zero 408 688 5409 knowledge , reputations , information markets , w . a . s . t . e . aptos , ca black markets , collapse of governments . higher power 2 756839 public key pgp and mailsafe available .
4			housing	taxation	jew	investing	finance			 investment in yehuda and shomron  while i applaud investing of money in yehuda , shomron , v chevel azza , in order to create jobs for their residents , i find it deplorable that this has never been an active policy of any israeli administration since 1967 , with regard to their jewish residents . past governments found funds to subsidize cheap read affordable housing and the requisite infrastructure , but where was the investment for creating industry which would have generated income and jobs ? the investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks , and employer benfits . you are overlooking the difference that these could have made to any company . part of the problem was that few industries were interested in political settling , as much as profit . after 26 years , yehuda and shomron remain barren , bereft of even middle sized industries , and the jewish settlements are sterile bedroom communities , havens for in the main israelis both secular and religious who work in tel aviv or jerusalem but cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs . true , which leads to the obvious question , should any investment have been made there at the taxpayer's expense . obviously , the answer was and still is a resounding no.  shai guday stealth bombers , os software engineer thinking machines corporation the winged ninjas of the skies . cambridge , ma

2			helmet	bicycle	cycling	motorcycle	bike	speed			 cnn california mc helmet law article  hey ! it works . you could present the paragraph above to virtually any member of the non motorcycling public and they will buy right into it .  just about any argument you can produce in favor of banning helmetless riding can be used to argue in favor of banning motorcycles . it's just a matter of degree . that's absurd ! that statement must therefore say that any argument in favor of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles . any argument for lifeguards is an argument against swimming . it says that any agrgument in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to which the precautions apply . extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous , there wouldn not be any normal human activity left to do ; therefore it is a non seqitur . also , even though most people do not ride motorcycles , they do boat , sail , jetski , climb , ski , fly parachute , hang glide , glide , bungee jump , bike , skate , rollerblade , skateboard , play rugby ouch , mow the lawn , rewire the basement , operate heavy machinery , and do a host of other would angerous things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban . your little homily applies to all those things , and the general public buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity would be next is unlikely .  terry cunningham donuts ! is there anything they dod 541 diviner of dreams can not do ? homer hifi 2
1			mac	computer	color	hardware			 sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement ? what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck . it should have been made fairly clear that the most crimson would ever get was a 150 75 old style mhz cpu upgrade . certainly this was mentioned on comp . sys . sgi on more than one occasion as being likely . if our sales folks were saying otherwise , they were either confused , or less than honest ethical , or somebody further up the chain inside sgi was misleading them . i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while , rather than being flushed . there were 4 versions 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35 , over a period of 2 1 2 years . the chassis simply couldn not be pushed any further . i would say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan , myself , for a system design in this day and age . getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups ; we would have been out of our minds to push it further , and i know that was made clear , almost from the day the 35 started shipping . we had one last kicker in the form of the elan graphics , which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan , which i also think is pretty good . now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter , but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process . please , by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support or sales on your concerns . there should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure , sometimes there will be confusion for a while , over whether an upgrade will be available , but that shouldn not last too long , and doesn not seem to be what you are referring to . yes , the sales folks do get bonus's at the end of some all ? quarters , but that is pretty common industry wide , and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren not what they need , i m sure , but nobody is forcing you to buy at end of quarter , after all . maybe it's because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies , so we aren not entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa , for instance are . this lab , and i suspect that a lot of other labs they don not get all that long a lead time either ; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products , and their opinions may well influence the end product , but that also is life in the industry . we can not design systems that meet just their needs , or we won not sell too many systems , after all which is not to say that we don not have some niche products , like reality engine . and organizations , doesn not have a load of money to spend on computers every year , so we can not be out buying new systems on a regular basis . the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond . that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one previous poster's words , not o fill a niche to compete with some other vendor . i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years . and every time i look at it , i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money , since we are supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars . but surely you don not expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period ? that's a rather unreasonable expectation , in my experience with workstations microcomputers . supported , and parts available , yes , but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest ! now you will have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark , libelous thoughts . i missed your first posting , but as i say , by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might have an effect not immediate , i m sure , but complaints aren not going to be ignored , and may affect future plans , if we hear similar things from more than one person site . all of the above is , as usual , my personal opinion , not sgi's .  let no one tell me that silence gives consent , dave olson because whoever is silent dissents . silicon graphics , incorporation maria isabel barreno ps i start my sabbatical 29 may , ask those questions now ;

5			conspiracy	religion	ethic	terrorist	democracy			 political atheists ? perhaps we shouldn not imprision people if we could watch them closely instead . the cost would probably be similar , especially if we just implanted some sort of electronic device . why wait until they commit the crime ? why not implant such devices in potential criminals like communists and atheists ? sorry , i don not follow your reasoning . you are proposing to punish people before they commit a crime ? what justification do you have for this ? no , mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism , not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer . what he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals . this may not , on the surface , sound like a bad thing , but who defines what a potential criminal is ? if the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice , this is not conducive to a free society . mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person , regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is . basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly , therefore , a deterrant to future offenders . mathew sees it , most probably , as a means of rehabilitation for the offender . so he was being cynical at you , okay ? jeff .
4			jerusalem	violence	jew	religion	terrorist	war	islam			 x newsposter tmail version 1 . 20r israeli destruction of mosque s in jerusalem  i am not aware of any such incidents .   i have read most of the history books dealing with this period , good and bad , and while it is possible that i missed one or two , none of those i have read documents any razing of mosques . so i think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation .  for the forgetful newcomers , here are the references .  the reference i based my posting on originally is the book the west bank story , by rafik halabi new york harcourt brace jovanovich 1982 . original title die westbank story .  quoting from the west bank story , pages 35 36 on the night of june 10 , an israeli officer marched from door to door through the moghrabi quarter of east jerusalem giving the residents three hours notice to evacuate their homes .  . the participants in a july 24 , 1967 meeting of a group of arab relgious and political figures protested the immodest dress of israelis visiting the mosques and the destruction of two mosques in the moghrabi quarter adjacent to the western wall .  this issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of just one reference probably won not resolve this issue to those that oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed . even in your location of this one reference , you spend most of your quote dealing with an incidence that , while abhorrant , has nothing to do with the issue at hand here . then , at the end of the quote , there is an almost off hand comment that two mosques were destroyed . tim , you are missing the big sleight of hand here . i can accept every word quoted from halabi and still have zero evidence of any mosques being razed . note that what halabi refers to is not that mosques were razed but that people protested alleged razing . too well we know that this is a common demagogic tactic or has anyone forgotten the temple mount riots , when the moslem crowd was led to believe that the israeli guards were there to cover for the tmf instead of stop them ? d . c . sessions speaking for myself note new network address author and everything else ! of tmail dos mail news shell

2			time	baseball	rule	softball			 braves update ! that he would been thrown out . and gant had a legitimate beef about the 1 0 pitch that was called a strike . a reasonable umpire would not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation . a reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of games . i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if the batter won not get back in the box . while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around , gant wasn not ordered back in the box sooner , he was ordered back immediately . as soon as he stepped out , hirschbeck told him to get back in the box . now , gant doesn not take a lot of walks between pitches . the only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the call . i expect his concentration wasn not there yet , and in a crucial situation i imagine it's best to be as calm as possible . contributing factors would be gant's bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the braves long scoring drought . now , it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there . you know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike , throw you out , etc . gant was wrong . but hirschbeck was more wrong , in my biased view . aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem . gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call . gant hadn not been wasting time all game . the game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old . the score was 1 0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position . is there any reason hirschbeck couldn not , and shouldn not , cut gant a little slack ? for no discernible constructive reason , hirschbeck disrupted the game , caused a five minute delay , and materially hurt the batter in a key situation . did he have a date to get to ? and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game .  dale j . stephenson baseball fanatic it is considered good to look wise , especially when not overburdened with information j . golden kimball
4			politics	democracy	murder			 letter in colorado daily the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal's article on paxton quigley , including the nefarious little paragraph the journal tacked onto the end . after recieving much assistance from various t . p . g . type folks , i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph , and surprise , surprise , surprise , they published it . the text follows . the colorado daily , btw , is the university of colorado boulder student i think newspaper . not exactly a big coup , but every little bit , i guess . the title was the only thing they changed added gun stats the daily recently reprinted an article from the wall street journal , primarily concerned with paxton quigley , author of armed and female . the article , in turn , cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the new england journal of medicine . the article states , a study . found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner , spouse , a friend , or child than to kill an intruder . this is an often quoted statistic , and it is misleading for sev eral reasons , outlined below the study gives the impression that , if you own a gun , the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you . the study , however , fails to take into account cases where a law abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime , without actually killing the perpe trator . the study actually refers to acquaintances rather than friend . this would include the friendly neigh borhood thug who shows up like clockwork , every month , the second your grandmother cashes her social security check . possibly an acquaintance , but hardly a friend . the nejm study is based on the immediate dis position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self defense . especially considering the small sample size 396 , taking these events into account has a sub stantial effect on the 43 1 ratio quoted . criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif erent statistic a gun is 33 times more likely to be used , successfully , by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all . further , per sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means , or who offer no resistance at all . statistics available from the fbi and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide , 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody , and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide . it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics . one has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu rate conclusion from them . d . f . taylor cu department of chemistry and biochemistry  spooksmoke revolution , assasination , thorium , cobalt 60 , clintin , cia , nsa , shc dod 202 liberty or death send me something even you can not read . begin pgp public key block version 2 . 2 mqcnaitfksqaaaeeakceejwi9f5kmjykp0logc5dghrpbmy2xhoo8kpehmdyuf8a 1bfdqsj53kostz6hroshsdzlvul1 40vpjmmntfr vyz4jvd3rl4iuq2ummmex3m itf3ult8xn v qabsvhcfshvjvk4lf6wosucmo03m2tix31ai7vb0uzo4yxjaaux tcreyw5pzwwgribuyxlsb3igpexva2laywnjys5ubxn1lmvkdt4 s5ib end pgp public key block

5			satan	jesus	faith	religion	christianity	christ	truth	christian	god			 davidians and compassion do you judge all christians by the acts of those who would call themselves christian and yet are not ? the bd's contradicted scripture in their actions . they were not christian . simple as that . perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed . ask any true believing christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the bd's . even the 7th day adventists have denied any further ties with this cult , which was what they were . well , if they were satanists , or followers of an obscure religion , then i would be sure that christians would in unison condemn and make this to a show case . but when we are dealing with a fanatical revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone , including the innocent children , then it seems that we are dealing with christians and christians note the spelling .  do you judge all muslims by the acts committed by saddam hussein , a supposedly devout muslim ? i don not . saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends . and does not this show the dangers with religion in order word a mind virus that will make mothers capable of letting their small children burn to ashes while they scream ? cheers , kent  . alink ksand private activities on the net .

4			rape	homosexuality	sex	sexuality	condom			 still waiting for evidence , mr. cramer gay men constitute at least 20 of all child molestations . whether this is because gay molesters are unusually common , or have unusually high numbers of victims , sort of misses the point , doesn not it ? it means that whichever is the case , homosexual men are remarkably hazardous to children .  clayton says  you are incorrect . the most recent survey data i can find shows that 26 of molestation is exclusively homosexuals , 4 is bisexual victims are both male and female , and the remainder is exclusively heterosexual . so what you are saying is that 74 of the child molestations are committed by heterosexuals . i cannot see the correlation you cite bisexuals are heterosexuals ? since when ? which concludes that by being homosexual , you will molest children or that by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children . i haven not said that homosexual child molester , simply that is more likely . if 26 of the molestations are by homosexuals , why are you so concerned about creating a relation between the two ? if you had evidence that 95 of the molestations are committed by homosexuals you might find a relationship . ok , where is the realtionship you make ? the one that is shown when nambla marches in gay parades . also , what is the reason people molest ? from human sexuality and a psych class or too i have taken the overwhelming voice says that people commit these acts as power trips and to feel in control . this has nothing to do with sexual orientation . you mean that s&m , because it's a power trip , has nothing to do with sexual orientation ?   clayton e . cramer uunet , pyramid ! optilink ! cramer my opinions , all mine ! relations between people to be by mutual consent , or not at all .

4			lebanon	violence	hezbollah			 was go hezbollah ! an untried approach     well , you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the retaliatory shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israeli backed forces . my team , you see , was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands , so to speak .  i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda . there are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in retaliation to pin point attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the lebanese terrorists .  if the attack was justified or not is at least debatable . but this is not the issue . the issue is that you were cheering death .  dorin  dorin , of all the criticism of my post expressed on t . pm , this one i accept . i regret that aspect of my post it is my hope that the occupation will end and the accompanying loss of life but i believe that stiff resistance can help to achieve that end . despite what some have said on t . pm , i think that there is a point when losses are unacceptable . the strategy drove u.s. troops out of lebanon , at least  brad hernlem hi brad , i have two comments regarding your hope that the occupation will end . belive that stiff resistance . etc. how about an untried approach , i.e . peace and cooperation . i can not help but wonder what would happen if all violence against israelis stopped . hopefully , violence against arabs would stop at the same time . if a state of non violence could be maintained , perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved , i.e . greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the territories . of course , given the current leadership of israel , your way may work also but if that leadership changes , e.g . to someone with ariel sharon's mentality , then i would predict a considerable loss of life , i.e . no winners . secondly , regarding your comment about the u.s. troops responding to stiff resistance the analogy is not quite valid . the u.s. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether . the israelis could not . just my $ . 02 worth , no offense intended . respectfully , ben .

4			hospital	health	cancer	sex	medicine	healthcare			 top ten signs that it's the age of aquarius on pennsylvania avenue  6 . hey , i think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's esque touch ! aaaaaaaaaaaa ! run ! run for your lives ! 5 . look , canada , europe , and japan manage to provide health care for their citizens and , yes , basic health is a human right which people are entitled to . if these nations aren not capitalist enough for you , then i guess we have found something better than capitalism ! there is nothing sacred about the capitalist system , and if something , be it socialism or anything else , works better , then i say let capitalism die . then why are they in the process of systematically dismantling some of their socialistic health care systems through privitization of key components ? 4 . make love , not war ! if i hold a gun to your wife , would you respond the same way ? i don not think so . while the age of aquarius may have hit the white house , the age of peace love and harmony hasn not hit in south central la nor has it hit in former yugoslavia . and as long as there are people in the world who would rather see me dead than thrive , i want the protection of a police force who will keep the peace so i can make love without being shot . 3 . contrary to popular belief , it is possible to be a male and a feminist at the same time . to discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity to a majority of the population is just plain wrong , and trying to force them into some sort of tradition role is even worse . women certainly have as much to offer this world as men , and the day that gender discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of the past few centuries seem like reform bills . i look forward to it . the ultimate statement for equal rights something many of the feminazis have forgotten is i do not care if you are either a man or a woman , i do not care if you are black or white , i do not care if you are gay or straight . once you can honistly say i do not care about color , race , or gender or sexual preference , then we will truly be on the right track . keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along ? get real ! so long as you try to make me care if you are black , female , or whatever , i am going to continue to balk . it's natural human behaviour . but the moment employers searching for employees , banks looking to lend money , and theclinton administration looking for appointees can honistly say i do not care about your color , race , gender , or sexual preferences ; i instend instead to treat you as a human being , crap like last year's riots will continue to happen . 1 . hey man , acadamia rules ! barf . you mean the same economic theorists who say things like for the sake of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is no wealth creation now get a crack at implementing their phd thesis in real life ? go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory . look in the first chapter of that book , introducing the field of macroeconomic theory . right there in chapter 1 , section 1 , is a statement like the following as it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation , especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently the province of individuals who create new inventions and discover new ideas , we will assume for the rest of this book that there is no wealth creation . we do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world , however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently unpredictable subject is impossible . even though we assume no wealth creation , we do believe that for most mathematical economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested . so the guys who are running the store for clinton and company are now assuming that wealth creation does not exists . they are borrowing an idea from the hitchhiker's guide too advanced to think of these simple things . to be honist , i would rather have an engineer with years of experience building bridges design the next bridge , rather than a theoretical physicists with a freshly minted phd and no experience do the same job . bill woody normally i don not post or even read most of the postings in this newsgroup . if you would like to reply to this message and want me to see the reply , then i guess you will just have to reply directly to me .

1			computer	problem	hacking			 quadra scsi problems ? i would like more info on this if anybody has it . our exabyte 8500 tapedrive has never been working from the quadra 950 . we have been trying it since september 1992 , replaced cabling , inits , i don not know what all . all the industry experts we phoned the tapedrive dealer , our apple dealer , the software dealer all say it's our fault , or they don not know . the last thing they said was that we needed a special quadra scsi terminator ? anybody know more ? thanks ,  i don not know about the specific problem mentioned in your message , but i definitely had scsi problems between my q700 and my venerable jasmine megadrive 10 cartridge drives . my solution was to get silverlining . none of the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives ; in fact the only loop that worked was the macintosh software loop whatever that means .  i doubt this is a quadra specific problem . i had to get rid of my venerable bernoulli 20 last year with enough cartridges purchased at $ 90 each to make the whole thing worth more than my whole computer ; the tech support guys at ocean microsystems suggested that some third party drivers might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn not format mount partition for a ux .  all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my mac plus and my powerbook 140 . it was for this reason i assumed the problem had something to do with the quadra . even with the quadra , they mostly worked ok . the problem occurred when i ejected a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes saying this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware even though there was no cartridge in the drive .  mark i have been using the pli sony 3 . 5 mo drive and now a sharp color scanner using standard scsi cables and standard $ 20 terminator on my q700 . no problems. if you were using a iifx , that might be another story . make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end . some boxes have internal terminators ; some can be switched out and others are socketted . these count . if the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling , they have to be disabled , ie , switched out or pulled out of their sockets . if you have 2 boxes with internal terminations , the terminations in one box has to be disabled . etc. i am sure that this has been covered by the experts . my experience with scsi boxes that connect to the mac indicates that they must have some software package for the mac to not alk to them . my pli mo drive and sharp scanner has one for each . good luck . art beattie  i only speak for myself .

5			politics	america	war	democracy	freedom	iraq			 death penalty gulf war long which liberal news media are we talking about ?  western news in general , but in particular the american mass media cbs , nbc , abc , etc. the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor , poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits .  most odd . over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi civilians until towards the end of the war ; and then it was confined to the few remaining quality newspapers . true . at first , the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using , not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets . but later , and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit , they changed their tone . it seemed to me that they didn not have the stomach for the reality of war , that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare . it's like they were only pro gulf war as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military hqs , but not when pictures of dead , dying , and maimed civilians started cropping up . what naive hypocrites !  how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww2 ? i don not hear you bemoaning them ! discussion about blanket bombing and a bombs deleted .  all things considered , the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick  end to avoid even greater allied losses . i should have said here militarily justified . it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified . i apologize .  what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after hiroshima but before nagasaki ? is that another lie peddled by the liberal media conspiracy ? i have often wondered about this . i have always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japan's island fortress of truk . a good , inpenatrable military target . the second bomb could have been held back for use on an industrial center if need be . but i digress . yes , i have heard that we found evidence after the war , btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb . unfortunately , the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us's ulimatum . therefore the second bomb was dropped . most unfortunate , imo .  i , for one , don not regret it .  nuke a jap for jesus !  i don not regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people . but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary , and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions . . why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor , bosnia , or even tibet ? if iraq is so bad , why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing ?  i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war . it is evident that the west , especially america , misjudged hussein drastically . but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply , he had to be stopped .  oh , i see . so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of people , but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gas guzzling car , well , the man's gotta go . actually , it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action . if some back water country took over some other back water country , we probably wouldn not intervene . not that we don not care , but we can not be the world's policman . or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion , then we still wouldn not have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia . but the combination of the two , an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west's oil interests , caused us to take action .  i have moved a paragraph from here to later on  .  if we hadn not intervened , allowing hussein to keep kuwait , then it would have been appeasement .  right . but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action ? or are you just setting up a strawman ?  i m not setting up a strawman at all . if you want to argue against the war , then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait . diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective . i guess we shouldn not have fought ww2 either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg .  yes , do . germans are human too , you know .  sure . what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich . the consequences stemmed from that .  translation they were asking for it .  well , in a sense , yes . they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to . but what about those who didn not support hitler's dreams of conquest ? it's not as if they democratically voted for all his policies . the nsdap got 43 in the elections of 1933 , and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter . they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much ? the world is full of evil , and circumstances are not perfect . many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others . it it regretable , but that's the way it is . there are no perfect solutions . .  i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet .  what should i say about them ? anything in particular ?  the people of east timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that invaded their country . hell , even western journalists have been killed . all this was happening before the gulf war . why didn not we send in the bombers to east timor ? why aren not we sending in the bombers now ? probably because we are not the saviors of the world . we can not police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another . nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet , east timor , or some other places .  here's that paragraph i moved  what's your intent ? to sound like a loving christian ? well , you aren not doing a very good job of it .  well , it's not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them . or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion . so , i would have to say yes , stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest  the chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of tibetans . tibetan people are rounded up , tortured , and executed . amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china .  why aren not we stopping them ? in fact , why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them ? tell me how we could stop them and i will support it . i , for one , do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it . i agree that it is deplorable .  and as for poor , poor rodney king ! did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty ?  yes . amongst the things i thought were hmm , there's an awful lot of white people in that jury .  so ? it was the policemen on trial not rodney king !  erm , surely it's irrelevant who's on trial ? juries are supposed to represent a cross section of the population . are they ? or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held ? normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order . i m not an expert on california law , or even us law , but it seems that this is the way the system is set up . you can criticize the system , but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around .  and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers !  you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people ? no , not at all . the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant .  this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow .  this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them is really stupid . should the nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made up of nazis ? germans , perhaps . peers doesn not mean those who do the same thing , like having murderers judge murderers . it means having people from the same station in life , presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation s .  those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape . but the jury looked at all the evidence , evidence which you and i have not seen .  when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who's lying defenceless on the ground , it's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been .  so ? it's hard to imagine ? so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument ?  we are not talking about a logical argument . we are talking about a court of law . as the faq points out , some fallacious arguments are not viewed as fallacies in a court of law . ok , granted . however , you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion . this is not a court of law .  if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true , then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one .  were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy ?  the media is not totally monolithic . even though there is a prevailing liberal bias , programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news . there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look . hurrah for rush ! btw , i never used the word conspiracy . i don not accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources . thou shalt not kill . unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing , in which case thou shalt kill , and also kill anyone who gets in the way , as unfortunately it cannot be helped . jim brown bible for loving christians  thanks mathew , i like the quote . pretty funny actually . i m a monty python fan , you know . kind of seems in that vein .  of course , oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory . but then , you know that already .  ha ha , only serious .  i , an atheist , am arguing against killing innocent people .  you , a supposed christian , are arguing that it's ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well . hardly . i didn not say that it's a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately , we don not live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions . if one is going to resist tyranny , then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die . i didn not say it is ok it is unfortunate , but sometimes necessary .  i , a moral relativist , am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at the end of world war ii was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act . i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering . i m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say . that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved . and perhaps it was unnecessary as let's say we now know . that doesn not mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn not see it as being necessary . rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision . at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it . but don not assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified i don not ! i just don not condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances .  you , having criticised moral relativism in the past , are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war . you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i , as an absolutist , am in a position to judge , but i defer judgment . you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular context of the time , and that they might have been moral then but not moral now . wrong . they were neither moral then nor now . they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war . i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision .  where's your christian love ? where's your absolute morality ? oh , how quick you are to discard them when it suits you . as ivan stang would say , jesus would puke ! one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action ; even this discourse in this forum . i understand the full ramifications of that , and i am prepared to do so . i don not believe that you can make the same claim .  mathew and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn not accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time . but in the gulf war , precision bombing was the norm . so the point was , why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing , when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww2 ? even with precision bombing , mistakes happen and some civilians suffer . but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history ! many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids . the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . yes , bunk . the us lost 230 , 000 servicemen in ww2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months ! and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that ! what hogwash . if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died , it was due to actions hussein took on his own people , not due to the allied bombing . regards , jim b .

3			health	nutrition	cooking			 barbecued foods and health risk this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw . today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot ! he used a strange technique i would never seen before .  he took a big pot with lid , and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil . the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray , made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges .  in the tray , he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar , a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do , the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea , and a few cloves .  on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer , with two chicken breasts in it . the lid was put on , and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes .  later , he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts . what surprises and concerns me are  1 no wood chips . where does the smoke flavor come from ?  2 about 5 or 10 years ago , i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic . i believe they injected it under the skin of rats , or something . if the results were conclusive , caramel color would not be legal in the u.s . yet it is still being used . was the initial research result found to be incorrect , or what ?  3 about 5 or 10 years ago , i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic , because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit . does anyone know whatever happened with that story ? if it were carcinogenic , earl grey tea could not have it as an additive , yet it apparently continues to do so .  wrt natural wood smoke i have smoking a duck right now , as it happens , i have noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing . i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips , getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process , then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips .  my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff , like terpenes , and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar . the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff , just leaving the flavor behind . does anyone know if my theory is correct ?  i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic . for that reason , and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess , i only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals . i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat . i have a long rectangular weber , and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end . the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat , and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals .  and yet another reason i have heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat , like pork sausage and bacon , contains nitrosamines , which are carcinogenic . i m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing , don not know about the others .  an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal , when it was discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils . this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic . the guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal broiled steaks . what a great analogy ! when i first heard that , my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit ! one charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0 . 5 duncans ! i don not understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the u.s . i think that naturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food , food additives or other consumption . it's only when the chemists concoct sp ? an ingredient that it falls under fda regulations . otherwise , if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything . how in the world do you suppose it's legal to consume tobacco products which probably should be banned ? dave allen space science & engr . ctr . uw madison

3			autism	cancer	medication			 acutane , fibromyalgia syndrome and cfs reply to daniel prince  there is a person on the fido cfs echo who claims that he was cured of cfs by taking accutane . he also claims that you are using it in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome . are you using accutane in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome ?  yes .  have you used it for cfs ?  it seems to work equally well for cfs , another hint that these may be different facets of the same underlying process .  have you gotten good results with it ?  yes . the benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it . most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low dose amitriptyline , daily aerobic excersise , and a regular sleep schedule current standard therapy . because of the cost usually $ 150 mo . depending on dose and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects , i currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment . it is important that the person prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient closely .  are you aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in these conditions ? thank you in advance for all replies .  as far as i know , i am the only person looking at it currently . i should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports . i m not an academic physician , so i don not feel the pressure to publish or perish and i don not have the time during the work day for such things .  david nye . midelfort clinic , eau claire wi this is patently absurd ; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities . bertrand russell

5			religion	people	god			 intolerance eternal life etc i apologize if this article is slightly confusing , and late . the origonal draft didn not make it through the moderators quote screens . so i did violence to it , but if you remember the article i am responding to it should still make sence . hi xian netters , god bless you what , no hello for heathan netters ? i feel all left out now . deletia table of content , intro , homosexuality  incredibly chopped up post deletia incorrect attributions uh , you have your attributions wrong , you were responding to my article , so dan johnson should be the 1st one . deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat . i find that i am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves . little in the cosmic sense . ah , in the cosmic sence . but who lives in the cosmic sence ? not me ! cosmicly , we don not even exist for all practical purposes . i can hardly use the cosmic sence of stuff as a guide to life . it would just say don not bother . luckily for mortals , there are many sences of scale you can talk about . in a human sence , you can have big purposes . even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone , the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind , eventually to be turned into dust but the influence of aristotle , confucious , alexander , ceasar and countless others is still with us , although their works have perished . but they have changed to course of history , and while humanity exists , their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing , even if they are utterly forgotten . mankind itself will one day perish . one day , surely . well , unless you believe in the second coming , which i do not but in that time we can make a difference . without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical , without god , it is all pointless in the end . in the end . but it must be the end ; until then , there is all the point you can muster . and when that end comes , there will be nobody to ask , gee , i don not think james sledd's deeds are gonna make much of a difference , ulitmately , ya know ? but they will have already have made a difference , great or small , before the end . why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile ? most people are able to live with that , and for them little purposes success , money , power , effecting change , helping others suffice . little is in the eye of the beholder , of course . i suppose they never think about the cosmic scale , or are at least able to put it out of their minds . i don not doubt it . but i have thought about the cosmic scale . and it does not seem to mean much to us , here , today . to me , it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion . i would not find this comforting . but perhaps it is merely my definitions . here's what i think the relevant terms are reality that which is real . illusion that which is not real , but seems to be . real objectively existing for reality to be an illusion would mean , then that which is real is not real , but seems to be . or that which objectively exists , does not objectively exist , but does seem to objectively exist from which we can conclude , that unless you want to get a contradiction , that no things objectively exist but i have a problem with this because i would like to say that i objectively exist , if nothing else . cogito ergo sum and all that . perhaps you do not mean all that , but rather mean objective reality is unreachable by humans . which is not so bad , and so far as i know is true . that the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit . have on . if reality is an illusion , isn not true reality an illusion too ? and if true reality is spirit , doens not that make spirit an illusion as well ? if i am not distinctly confused , this is getting positively buddhist that this world is a school of sorts , where we learn and grow , and our souls mature . that is one hell of a statement , although perhaps true . do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so ? if so , please show that this is true . if not , please explain how this can give a purpose to anything . that gives a purpose to my little purposes , how does it do that ? wouldn not the world school w intent idea make the world a preparation for some greater purpose , rather than a purpose in itself . and takes some of the pressure off . what pressure ? it's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you are really just here to learn . it is not necessary to be a success in human terms , unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be achived . indeed , many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as i understand it . check out yer buddhist monk type guy . out for nirvana , which is not at all the same thing . it's more important to progress , grow , persist , to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love , especially when it's dificult to do so . honest effort is rewarded by god , he knows our limitations . why is learning to love a goal ? what happens if you fail in this goal ? to you ? to god ? to the mysterious purpose ? deletia question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly quote . two serious questions invitations to discussion 1 . what is the nature of eternal life ? 2 . how can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it ?  possible answer for 2 the best we can do is metaphor analogy question 2a what is the best metaphor ? i will have a crack at that . 1 the nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name it is the concept of life without death , life without end . 2 no. we can put together word to describe it , but we cannot imagine it . 2a no metaphor is adequate next to eternity ; if it were we could not understand it either . or so i suspect  dan johnson and god said jeeze , this is dull . and it was dull . genesis 0 0 these opinions probably show what i know .

5			faith	religion	christianity	skepticism	denial	reason	truth	atheist	god			 the arrogance of christians in a previous article , says to demand scintific or rational proof of god's existence , is to deny god's existence , since neither science , nor reason , can , in their very nature , prove anything .  are you asking us to believe blindly ? you are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question does god exist ? i.e. self awareness and reason . if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth . does god want us to be like that ?  i am asking you to believe in things not visible . i don not know if this is believeing blindly or not . i m not sure how blindness comes into it . i do not deny reason , indeed i insist upon it , but reason only draws conclusions from evidence . if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses , then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the rather provocative , if inconclusive , conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory . christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence , which they call faith , and which is a gift of god . that is , this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself . the evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists . reasoning on the evidence of the senses won not help either . but christians do reason of the evidence of faith , and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses , and indeed , that the evidence of these other senses is part of god's revelation of himself to us . it is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a god must come through this route . there may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non physical realities . there may , of course , be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses , for all we know . these senses , if they exist , may provide valid evidence for reason to work on . and , as with all senses , these senses may be impaired in some people , that is , they may be spiritually blind . in this sense , belief in god becomes an act of sight , and it is disbelief which is blind . you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything . however , if we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone . and since we can only use faith , why is one picture of god e.g. hinduism any less valid than another e.g. christianity ?  faith , as i have said , is not opposed to reason , it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate . it is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses , and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith . religious believers in general , and christians in particular , use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith . science claims , with good reason , to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe , and christianity claims , also with good reason , to be the most valid system , possessed of the best evidence , for explaining gods revelations of himself to man . if you doubt that christians use reason , read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty .   mark baker the task . is not to cut down jungles , but to irrigate deserts . c . s . lewis

2			car	bicycle	cycling	motorcycle	riding	bike	biking			 squids and dealers yesterday , a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer . it has been a while since he last rode 10 years , and i myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer . what follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of squildly behavior by other customers and or sales personel background i ride with a group of friends , who mainly are into cruiser type bikes . my friend was hell bent on getting an intruder and had seen a few used ones . he wanted to see what the new ones were going for , so we happened upon a dealer that sold both suzuki and yamaha . the place was fairly busy , so we browsed a bit . we happened upon a few intruders , most of which had sold signs on . my friend had been bitten . well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat , i moseid on outside . the next thing i know , i see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in . i could stereo type the type of riders backward ball hat , oakley , iq 40 , but i won not . well they went inside , i didn not think much of it . i figured to each his own . i went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back , when i noticed the hormone gang talking to other salesdroids managers . lot's of laughter , jokes etc. no big deal . here is the part that concerned me . the hg and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out , where said hg members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts . at this point , one decided to see how much rubber a katana 600 could deposit in the drive . squids , i thought to myself . but i was appalled that the salesdroids manager not only condoned this behavior , but encourged it , to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour . the girl that was riding pillion on another bike , seemed rather hormonal about this display , and urged her pilot to quickly catch up . the others followed , making sure there kerkers could be heard as well as felt . i felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist i felt the eyes of those in cages , witnessing this display , then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels . needless to say , my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left . i will now turn off my frustration and go ride . peacefully , to clear my anger . i only hope that the cop who is following me home , has an open mind and doesn not associate me with them . btw , i can not afford a new bike .

3			electricity	energy			 vandalizing the sky .  it's vandalism because many people power companies do maliciously waste light .  maliciously implies evil intent . the lighting companies aren not going out of their way to spoil the sky . they just don not care .  if they can sell you or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent of its light , they make more money . never mind that your money is wasted .  it is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware . if that's what your city will buy , that's what the lighting company will sell . write a letter to city hall . that's fine idea , but it only works if the lighting power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures . for instance , a power company in virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type . yet , all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs one that wasted the light . thus , you couldn not even buy a good light from them . in most places , to get a good light , you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona . at some point , society starts to make rules . cars have to pass safety tests . companies have to meet pollution standards , etc . there are two ways to achieve this educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs . history seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work .  please note that i m not defending light pollution . the orignial focus of this thread was space based light sources .  agreed , so i won not respond again . it's important for all you spacers out there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that have been presented . just like congress , it would be best to consult the astronomers lovers of the night sky before you try some pr stunt to boost public knowledge about space .   josh hopkins find a way or make one . attributed to hannibal bob bunge
5			politics	corruption	justice			 the inimitable rushdie is it just me , or has this part gotten beyond useful ? gregg is not , as i understand his posts , giving any support to the bounty on rushdie's life . if that's correct , end of one point . gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most westerners don not accept . his comments about islamic law i think make a great deal of sense to him , and are even making a little sense to me now if a person is a member of a group religion or whatever they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum . the big bone of contention here that i m picking up is that in the west we have secular governments that maintain , more or less , a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups . i think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune note i didn not say in agreement with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government , and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen . with that in mind , it not possible under secular law legally as most people would define the term to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it . only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort contractual , etc is there any secular enforcement allowed by a group to a group member or past group member . a religion can , and often does , believe in and require additional duties of a group member . and it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways ostracism is common for example . but the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and or unaccepted onus on a person in conflict with secular law . this is the difference . in a theocracy , the requirements of the secular authorities are , by definition , congruent with the religious authorities . outside a theocracy , this is not necessarily true . religious requirements may coincide or may not . similiarly , religious consequences may or may not coincide with secular consequences if any . regards , dew  dewey henize sys net admin risc hardware 512 891 8637 pager 928 7447 x 9637

5			religion	god			 omnipotence was re speculations   3 . can god uncreate itself ?  no. for if he did , he would violate his own nature which he cannot do . it is god's nature to exist he is , after all , the i am which is a statement of his inherent existence . he is existence itself . existence cannot not exist .  then , as mentioned above , he must not be very omnipotent .  what do you mean by omnipotent here ? do you mean by omnipotent that god should be able to do anything everything ? this creates a self contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless . to be descriptive , omnipotence must mean being all powerful and not being able to do anything everything . let me illustrate by analogy . suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth . suppose further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations . the us has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the us see fit . the us would be militarily omnipotent . but suppose further that the us holds to a doctrine philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation , such as the current civil war in the former yugoslavian states . technically in this scenario the us would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess . but effectively the us could not intervene without violating its own policy of non interference . if the policy of non interference were held to strongly enough , then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated . effectively , the us would be limited in what it could actually do , although it had the power to do whatever it wanted . the us would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non interference policy . god is effectively limited in the same sense . he is all powerful , but he cannot use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he , himself is . i hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence . regards , jim b .

4			religion	holocaust	jew			 pre columbian american population levels you gave a good reference please , who was the author of plymouth plantation ? you could have given more on the travel accounts . radiating from someone who is incapable of providing a single scholarly source on his genocide apology program , it is rather amusing . again , where is your non existent list of scholars and scholarly sources ? here is mine an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at least 30 40 percent of the population of that republic . the memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and eye witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in 1926 with the title men are like that . other references abound . rachel a . bortnick the jewish times june 21 , 1990 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves . it certainly is possible to severe the artificial life support system of an imagined ethnic purity that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land . sahak melkonian 1920 preserving the armenian purity the crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the muslim population in soviet republic of armenia , karabag , bosnia and herzegovina is an islamic holocaust comparable to the extermination of 2 . 5 million muslims by the armenian government during the wwi and of over 6 million european jews during the wwii . tovfik kasimov azeri leader september 25 , 1992  today's ethnic cleansing policies by the serbian dictatorship against croatians and muslims of yugoslavia , as well as the soviet republic of armenia's against the muslim population of neighboring azerbaijan , are really no different in their aspirations than the

4			election	politics	equality	democracy			 re fillibuster   if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords , than we would almost have to state that the house of representatives was also . in fact , they both were , because the british government had much greater power than did the american system .  in principle no , in practice yes .  in principle no ? that they had less power of that they should have had less power ?  the british parliament in principle has absolute power . so does the monarch . much of the stability of the system rests on what is not defined clearly . in the case of a clear abuse by one side or the other the other side can act to remedy the situation . two institutions with absolute power . cute . let's talk practicality , shall we ? if the monarch tried to do something , what would happen ?  if they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current no state subsidy motto they would be better placed . as it is there is plenty of state money being handed out . the problem is that it is distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of actual need .  bingo . the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters , because political power can be concentrated at higher levels , while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness .  that was not my point . but you illustrated the problem very well . in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other 49 states with pork defense contracts , agricultural subsidies etc. or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster .  then why not simply leave new york's education to new york ? i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do .  the point is of redistribution of cash from the poor areas of the ecconomy to the rich ones . i am contending that there is no state in the union which does not have ample wealth , if they choose to spend it , to run a perfectly acceptable education system . i further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient , but is being spent badly . or vice versa if you aren not a republican . so , tell me phill . were the republicans also responsible for some of the huge increases in social programs ? or were they only responsible for what you don not like . i contend it is congress which is to blame . democrat and republican alike . if society simply writes off any areas of the country that is ecconomically weak you end up with a basket case ecconomy . there are inevitable cycles in any business . some of these act in phase to produce the business cycle . others are countercyclic . localities can experience boom to bust cycles outside the national trend . to produce a strong ecconomy you need to ensure that the bust areas do not fall bellow the level where they cannot be ecconomically rebuilt . most of our worst areas are still better off than most of europe . in any case , we are talking about education . if the industry in an area collapses the us as a whole still has a responsibility to ensure that the children in that area get a good education . in some areas of the us schools are closing halfway through the year for lack of money . yes , i live in once such area . you are woefully ignorant of the situation . at the same time some of tennessee's school districts are closing down , the governor asked for 7 . 5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats . in almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it .  i don not know about the rest of the country , but our education problems stem directly from two problems , neither of which are a lack of money in the state . btw , tennessee is considered a tax heaven and our economy is one of the strongest in the country . i see a correlation . 1 what money we spend goes primarly to administration . the average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes , and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue . and 2 the governor is making a concerted effort to create an education crisis in order to push for his pet income tax . some of the most idiotic programs get funded like state funds for new art in the county seat while schools are closing . it's not a lack of funds . it's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate . education is the parental hot button . education is always the first to but cut , because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art . the u.s. constitution is a nuts and bolts document . the delcaration of independence was the high brow reasoning . there are a couple of other examples , though , such as the reasoning for the power to tax , and the  the declaration on independence cam a decade earlier and has not a line of justification for the us constitution . you could argue that it went into the broad concepts but little more . it spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed . in fact it is little more than a protracted whinge . more to do with the price of tea than the design of a government . it would be a pretty daft idea for a bunch of guys to sit arround designing the structure of the new government while the little matter of the british army remained to be settled . they did it anyway . the continental congress had its own set of bylaws . it wasn not quite a government , but a means of making decisions had to be created . however low george washington's opinion of them were . to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something it wasn not intended . however , i also believe it is inevitable considering the congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say . unlike most people i think we shouldn not be worrying about the veto , which is fine , but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates its abuse .  the congress is the most democratic body in the whole system . allow me again to speak heresy against the holy democratic orders . so what ? the government was built with a very non democratic presidency with fairly broad powers , including the veto . it has not only the fairest system of election but the two year term means that the members have always got a recent mandate . yes , and the senate was intended to act as a balance to this . too much democracy was intentionally avoided . it was considered a good thing to place non democratic blocks to impulsive action . on the other hand if the period of election were to be made 4 years in antiphase to the presidential cycle there would be much less dependence on fund raising from special interests than there is at present . so long as congress has something to sell , people will pay for it . most congressmen rake in more money than they need . why not ? what is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action ? historically governemnt action in the u.s. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful . when you are in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people , why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority  in other words david thinks that the reactionaries should need only 41 votes while progressives should need 61 . no , if the progressives don not want the reactionaries to move backward , they get the same benefit . 41 of the states is a lot of people . and historically laws with that sort of minority arent very effective , especially since it is usually geographically concentrated . when wielding the federal big stick i don not see why they shouldn not have to make a better argument than , more people than not , agree .  now we know why nobody calls the republicans democrats . i m not a republican . i m a republican .  and no , i m neither a democrat nor a democrat .  now , i have asked several times , and all you have done is answer it isn not democratic , which i knew before i said it . why should it be democratic ? we don not have a true direct democracy , and few people advocate one . why , then , is this other modification of democracy to bias it against action so much worse ?  david veal univ . of tenn . div . of cont . education info . services group i still remember the way you laughed , the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft ; i m beginning to think you don not love me anymore . weird al

3			hacking	nsa	espionage	secrecy	encryption			 underground encryption was re text of white house announcement . it looks like the worst nightmares raised by dorothy denning's proposals are coming true . if the government continues on this course , i imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal . encryption programs for disk files and email , as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications , will be distributed only through the underground . people will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy . some thoughts has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside non encrypted data files ? many file formats can be written with gaps in them to hide other data . new file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden by dispersing it amongst the legitimate data . the hidden data would only show up with the right key s , and a file with hidden data would be indistinguishable from one without . so , only the correct key s would reveal the presence of an illegal document . if i devise a custom file compression algorithm and only i and a friend have the uncompressor , and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish , do i have the right to transmit the file ? will we have to escrow all our data file formats ? are gangs required to escrow their hand signals , colors and catch phrases ? i think that it's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach by replacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then re ask the question .

1			tire	mechanic	computer	linux	graphic	engine			 hercules graphite ? has anyone used a hercules graphite adapter ? it looks good on paper , and steve gibson gave it a very good review in infoworld . i would love to get a real world impression , though how is the speed ? drivers ? support ? the pc world reviewers found out that the herc people had hard coded winbench text into the driver . clever , no ? in any case , the winbench results are pretty much inflated . two things that annoyed me about the pc magazine review 1 . their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed , as was clearly shown by the graphite and 9gxe's cheating . can not they just admit that their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and or cheat on ? wintach is much harder to beat . 2 . the big cheat that hercules iit used was overlappipping bitblit and polyline optimization , and hercules sent them a new driver which didn not do this but produced almost identical scores . yet , the only thing pc magazine says is that scores are not legitimate couldn not they at least make some comment about its real world performance ? i m not so much going by winbench for performance , but , rather , by steve gibson's results , which are more real world based like using micrografx despite these documented cheats , i have to say that in real world applications the hercules graphite adapter actually draws faster than any other display adapter in the industry . even though it's just a modest isa bus card , it outperformed every local bus adapter i have , including the stealth 24 vlb , the fahrenheit 1280va vlb , the ati vlb mach32 and even the weitek p9000 based diamond viper vlb . this kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it , bogus winbench or not ! when and if you get one send me mail . i might buy that ati gu off you . 9 i already returned the ati gu . my dealer had sold eight of them , and seven were returned to him . i m now temporarily back to running an original ati gu , until i get my graphite . and , yes , the gu is faster in my 16 mb system than the gu , especially in bitmap handling that's where you use bitblits . hercules has a promotion available for vars and software developers you can buy one graphite or graphite vlb for 50 off list to try it out . at just $ 199 for graphite or $ 249 for the vlb version i decided it was worth trying i m supposed to get the vlb board within two weeks . i will post my impressions when i get it .  tom haapanen software metrics inc waterloo , ont stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth . now pull up . that's how the corrado makes you feel . car , january 93
2			petroleum	car	brake	fuel	gas			 where's the oil on my k75 going ?  after both oil changes , the oil level was at the top mark in the window on the lower right side of the motor , but i have been noticing that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the miles . i m always checking the window with the bike on level ground and after it has sat idle for awhile , so the oil has a chance to drain back into the pan . the bike isn not leaking oil any place , and i don not see any smoke coming out of the exhaust  my owner's manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the high and low marks in the oil level window is approx . 5 quart . it looks like my bike has been using about . 25 quarts 1000 miles . the owner's manual also gives a figure for max . oil consumption of about . 08oz mile or . 15l 100km .  my question is whether the degree of oil consumption i m seeing on my bike is normal ? have any other k75 owners seen their oil level gradually and consistently go down ? should i take the bike in for work ? i m asking local guys also , to get as many data points as i can . it's normal for the bmw k bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand miles . i don not know why . i have had three new k bikes , and all three used a bit of oil when new max maybe . 4 quart in first 1000 miles ; this soon quits and by the time i had 10 , 000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero . i have been told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner it stops using any oil . charlie smith kotdohl kotwitdodl 1kspi 22 . 85 dod 0709 doh 0000000004 & ama , moa , ra , buckey beemers , bk ohio v bmw k1100 lt , r80 gs pd , r27 , triumph tr6 columbus , ohio usa

2			canada	hockey	football	scoring	goal			 smiths birthday goal was leafs go all the way ! thanks for the goals by steve smith i don not see why more people don not blame grant fuhr for the goal that smith put in his own net , it's common to play the puck back to your own goalie when deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team . if fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line . from this account , it doesn not sound like you even saw the goal , mike . smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit fuhr in the back of the leg . fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened . the puck went straight off fuhr's leg and into the net . fuhr never had a chance . there was no play back to the goaltender , in fact perry berezan of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it . it was unfortunate that it happened ; smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time , and on his birthday too . but all the blame lies with him . starting in pee wee coaches tell players never to make a cross ice pass in front of their own net . too much chance of having it intercepted , or hitting the goaltender , or whatever . and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series , i can only say that he certainly didn not cause the team to lose the other three games . there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round . everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation . alan

3			atari	computing	chip	memory	computer	hardware	graphic			 atari 2600 processors the atari 2600 used a 6502 cpu , just like their entire 8 bit line 400 , 800 , 1200 , 1400 , 1440 , 130xe , 65xe computers , as well as the 5200 game machine . wrong , it has a 6507 . the 2600 had some extra asic chips that were basically modified graphics chips and pia's for the joysticks . it had one custome chip not an asic in the sense that word is now understood the tia sometimes known as the 6526 , although most other manufacturers list that as the cia complex interface adapter . tia stands for television interface adapter , and it handles sound , paddles and the minimal video hardware the 2600 possessed . there was also a standard 6532 ram , i o , timer riot , plus a voltage regulator and if memory serves a 555 timer . that's all . later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci , as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years . not according to the servicing documentation i have here . the 2600 did not change intenally very much at all . additionally , i think the 2600 used 2k , 4k , and up to 8k of rom for their games . roms were mapped into the upper 4k of the 6507's address space . 2k and 4k games were fine , but later 8k and 16k games needed bank switching . atari and others made much of these huge cartridges . i have no idea how much ram it had to work with , but i would hazard a guess of 2 or 4k ram . wrong , it had 128 bytes of ram from the riot . this was multiply mapped into both page 0 pseudo registers and page 1 stack , and also throughout the bottom 4k of memory . tia registers also sat in this address space . as 128 bytes of ram was somewhat limiting , some later cartridges also carried ram themselves , which was interesting as atari had provided no write line to the cart . this was managed by mapping the reads from ram into one address range , and the writes into another , but all the time this scheme ate into the very scarce rom address space . ian .

5			sex	religion	wedding			 when is a couple married . i used to be a marriage commissioner for the alaska court system sort of a justice of the peace . i had great difficulty with that duty . i used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies , mostly asking that the couples divine purpose in marriage couples who obviously didn not realize that marriage is god's institution , not the state's . gradually , however , i came to conclude that because i was acting in a strictly secular , public capacity , established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved , i was really conducting a purely secular , legal civil event , with no greater moral or religious implications than if i had been conducting a civil trial the couple who told me , mid ceremony , to please hurry it up may have helped me to this conclusion . i thought i had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before god , and marriage before the state , until i had to deal with my own divorce . keeping matthew 19 6 in mind , i felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before god , but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless . i would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension if intercourse , or the mental intent of the parties , or the ceremony of the church , or any combination thereof , establishes marriage , then at what moment is it dissolved ? karl thoennes iii university of alaska

3			science	nasa	radiation	alien	satellite	astronomy	space			 satellite around pluto mission ? is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to keep watch ? there would be some point to doing long term monitoring of things like particles and fields , not to mention atmospheric phenomena . however , there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network . to be precise , there is no particular plan , period . this is a large part of the problem . in this context , it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time . the closest approach to any sort of long term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like galileo or cassini . how about a mission unmanned to pluto to stay in orbit and record things around and near and on pluto . it is most unlikely that there is much happening on pluto that would be worth monitoring , and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for . the combined need to arrive at pluto within a reasonable amount of time , and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit , is beyond what can reasonably be done with current that is , 1950s vintage propulsion . it could do some scanning of not only pluto , but also of the solar system , objects near and aaroundpluto , as well as seti and looking at the galaxy without having much of the solar system to worry about . most of this can be done just about as well from earth . the few things that can not be , can be done better from a voyager like spacecraft that is not constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet .  svr4 resembles a high speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between svr3 and sunos . dick dunn utzoo ! henry

5			jesus	religion	david	god			 silence is concurance for those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between jim and i , jim wrote the following to me in email after i pointed out that he jim had taken a quote out of context in t . r . m . robert weiss writes a promise from psalm 9 10 gee , since you wouldn not be at all hypocritical , you must be really busy arguing against these out of context extracted translations ! he directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy , again based on a lack of response to an article by robert weiss , toward stephen . i pointed out that i did , in fact , agree that both robert weiss and jim meritt took quotes out of context . hence , i find it difficult to understand why jim thinks i am a hypocrite . needless to say , i don not have time to reply to every article on t . r . m . that takes a quote out of context . i asked jim the following so , according to you , jim , the only way to criticize one person for taking a quote out of context , without being a hypocrite , is to post a response to every person on t . r . m who takes a quote out of context ? jim replied by saying did i either ask or assert that ? but today we find four articles from jim , one of which has the subject silence is concurrence is it not the case that , in the eyes of the law , when someone is aware of something and has the capability of taking action and does not , that individual may be held responsible for that action ? which is , of course , a complete red herring . taking quotes out of context isn not a crime . i don not have time to read every article on t . r . m . and i m certainly under no obligation to reply to them all . does silence is concurrence imply that jim thinks that because i didn not respond to weiss articles i must condone weiss taking quotes out of context ? jim doesn not want to give a direct answer to this question ; read what he has written and decide for yourself . but back to the context of my conversation with jim . jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that i was being a hypocrite . i challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion . today we find another obscure article posting it twice didn not help make it more clear , jim , titled inductive logic scenario a white goose waddles past the door a white goose waddles past the door a white goose waddles past the door . repeat an uncountably large number of times . a black goose waddles past the door . an individual hits it with an axe .  1 . given that the population of geese is uncountably large , and the size of the confidence interval for the decision is undetermined , under what conditions could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese be made ?  2 . if only black geese are observed to be axed , is it not a valid question to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese ? more red herrings . could jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles ? could jim mean that because i axed his articles , but not weiss articles , he wants to conclude inductively . well , i can not see where he is going with this . but i can help him with his induction . i have written roughly 80 articles since january . the vast majority of them are discussions with frank decenso and other inerrantists , where i take the position that they are making bad arguments . some are discussions with jim meritt where i take the position that he is making bad arguments a straw man argument earlier , and taking quotes out of context more recently . think hard about this jim . see the pattern ? think harder . run it through your induction engine and see what pops out . dj

4			election			 treatment of armenians in azerbaijan 1 prelude to events today deposition of vitaly nikolayevich danielian 1 born 1972 attended 9th grade middle school no. 17 resident at building 4 2 , apartment 25 microdistrict no. 3 sumgait azerbaijan really , people in town didn not know what was happening on february 27 . i came home from school at 12 o clock , being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to baku . when we left , everything in town was fine . life was the same as usual , a few groups of people were discussing things , soccer and other things . then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first cousin's birthday , my father , my mother , and i . we spent the day in baku , and on the 28th , somewhere around 6 00 pm , we got on the bus for home , figuring that i would have enough time to do my homework for the next day . when we were entering town , near the 12 story high rises , our bus was stopped by a very large crowd . the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus . the driver says that there are no armenians on board ; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no armenians on board the group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one , not checking passports , just going by the way people look . we get off the bus , but are not taken for armenians . we set out in the direction of home . at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there would be a place to hide , but the whole road was packed with groups of people , all the way from block 41 to the 8th microdistrict . these groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports . people who didn not have passports with them were beaten as well . then we decided to go home instead . near the 12 story high rises i saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways , yelling . death to the armenians was written on the cars . when we came into the courtyard we live in an l shaped building it was still quiet . we went on upstairs , but didn not turn on any lights . we tried to call baku to warn our relatives , who were due to arrive on wednesday , not to come . then there was a knock at the door . it was our neighbors , who advised us to come down to stay at their place . we went down to their place , and they led us to the basement . they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony . we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beaten she ran away naked . our neighbors daughter said that that's right , that's what the armenians deserve , because in stepanakert , allegedly , people were being killed , 11 girls from agdam had been raped . we didn not stay very long in the basement . we tried to support one another as best we could , looking out the small window with the iron grating . papa watched and said things now and then . he said that there was a fire near building 5 , probably a car on fire . then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived . the neighbors said that there weren not any armenians here , and the group set out for the other wing of the building . they appeared from the 5 2 side of the building , where , i later found out , a woman had been murdered . the woman who ran away naked died . yuri avakian was killed , too . when the crowd left , the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home . we went back up to our place and again didn not turn on the light . we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while . we tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait , but there was no answer . we decided she had already left . we sat at home . the phone rang , and the caller asked to speak with my father . i called him to the phone . it was jeykhun mamedov , from my father's work brigade . he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town . he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city . to be quite honest , papa didn not want to give him our address , but my mother got on the phone and told him . some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway . bursting into the building , they broke down the door and came into the apartment . they came straight to our apartment , they knew exactly where the armenians were . they came into our place . we tried to resist , but there was nothing we could do . one of them took my parents passports and began to read them . he read the surname danielian , turned the page , read armenian , and that alone was enough to doom us . he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard , where they would have done with us . another , standing next to him , pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled . they had knives and steel truncheons . i had a knife in my hand . unfortunately , i didn not use it . i just knew that if i didn not give up the knife things would be much worse . they struck my parents and said that i should put the knife on the piano. then , one of them commanded that we be taken outside . one person was giving orders . when we were taken outdoors i went in the middle , and my mother was behind me . someone started to push her so she would walk faster ; i let her go ahead of me , and fell in behind her . when he tried to push me , i hit him , and at that moment they began beating my parents ; i realized that resistance was completely useless . we are taken out into the courtyard , and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next . the crowd surrounds us . at first they strike me , and i m knocked out ; when i come to , they beat me again . i lose consciousness often . i don not see or hear my parents , since i was the first one hit and was out cold . when i come to i try to pick them up ; they are lying next to me . the crowd is gone , the only people around are watching from their balconies . that's it . i try to pick them up , but can not . my left arm is broken . i start toward the drive , wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance . the bodies of my parents are still warm . we were attacked at around 9 o clock . i regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . when i knock at the neighbors door , they push me back and tell me to go away . i go up to the third floor , our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance ; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment . i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived , but i can not see very far as a result of the blows , and it seems that my parents have already been taken away . then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away , and everything will be ok . but they were still there . later , at 8 in the morning as i found out , the ambulance picked them up , but they were already dead . if they received attention on time , it is possible they would still be alive . later , around 12 o clock on the 29th , policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants . they call an ambulance , and 20 minutes later it arrives , and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital . there they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm . at 3 o clock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku . in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people , all of them armenians . the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians . the only azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events , before the 27th . then i was in the semashko hospital in baku . i was there 38 days . when i was released , on the 40th day , i found out that my parents were dead . at first they told me that they were in moscow being treated , but later i found out that they were dead . my father's older brother told me . my father's name was nikolai artemovich danielian . he was born in 1938 . my mother , born in 1937 , was seda osipovna danielian . papa worked at pmk 20 , the leader of the roofing brigade ; mamma was a compressor operator . they were also beaten on the head . the coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely . at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov , who had called . as it turned out later , he had been the one who tipped the crowd off . he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group . he knew the phone number , but didn not know the address . before the events i had never seen him , but had often spoken with him on the phone , when he would ask to speak with my father . i knew him by name . he denies that i was the one who answered the phone , saying that my father answered it . he denies that he called from a public phone , saying that he called from home , which also isn not true . i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles . as i later found out , earlier he had been convicted , but had never served any time he had received a suspended sentence . he was about 20 years old . i don not know if he has since confessed or not . i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off . one hundred percent sure . my parents were from karabagh . father was from the village of badar , and was two years old when his family moved to baku , where his elder brothers were to go to school . he was a student at the naval school , but never graduated . he went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev . when he returned he lived in baku , and later moved to sumgait , helping with the town's construction . mamma was from the village of dagdagan , also from karabagh . she worked in sumgait , first in a bookstore , and later , on a construction site . my sister is older than i . she lives with her husband here in karabagh . i always loved my parents . that was why i went on to 9th grade , because it was their dream that i would continue my studies . i finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the baku nautical school , and after that , the military school . but later i changed my mind , or rather , my parents got me to recon sider , saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the naval school . i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life long since childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor . my father wanted it more than anything . he always recollected his youth , telling of the school , and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it . now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here . i will stay at the home of my grandfather , of my ancestors , till the end of my days . while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well , like ishkhan trdatov . he managed to hold them off at their residence in microdistrict 3 , building 6 2 , apartment 6 . for a long time , lost his father gabriel , and by some miracle managed to survive . i also learned of uncle sasha , from building 5 2 , whose daughter was raped . besides them , valery i forgot his last name was in the hospital too , about a year younger than i , he went to school no. 14 . he was riding with his parents in the car . people were throwing rocks at them , he was hit , and his parents brought him to the hospital , and he was in our ward we even came to be friends . before that we had just seen each other around town . but in the hospital we got to know one another better . i learned of the fates of others , those who had died , or who were befallen by misfortune . today suren harutunian , the first secretary of the communist party of armenia , was shown on television . to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic . i was repelled , no , revolted , to hear the baku announcer who read the decision of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia . after the events in sumgait and those in baku , the best solution is to give karabagh to armenia , return it to armenia , since the people want to live peacefully with the azerbaijanis , but everything has to be right before they can do that . i arrived in karabagh on april 11 . i felt very bad . i had constant headaches . after a while my strength returned . my older sister , suzanna , took me in . i think that justice should prevail ; the people are demanding their due . you can not take away what is their due . my parents and i often spoke of nagorno karabagh , often visited here spent almost all of my vacations here . we had even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia , we would move here for sure . we always said that the armenian people had suffered much , and that what had been done in 1921 removing nagorno karabagh from armenia was wrong . sooner or later , mistakes should be corrected . and in order to correct a mistake , it must not be repeated ; and the fate of all nagorno karabagh lies in the hands of our government . june 13 , 1988 stepanakert  david davidian how do we explain turkish troops on s . d . p . a . center for regional studies the armenian border , when we can not po box 382761 even explain 1915 ? cambridge , ma 02238 turkish mp , march 1992

1			software	microsoft	windows	crash	computer	linux			 challenge to microsoft supporters . munch you must of read too many os 2 advertisements . crash protection is such a marketing gimick , it isn not funny . out of 4 months of using windows on my new machine i have only had it crash once , and i don not have a run of the mill configuration . munch following is reformatted it does sound funny , i will admit . but for me it is true . windows crashed on all of the time and from what i have read in pc mag , this is not the exception i would say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare . windows itself almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite ? any one of the corel 3 . 0 programs . on the other hand , i have had os 2 crash randomly a number of times , mostly just running it's own applications . for instance . today i discovered a new one . while i was downloading with procomm plus for windows running seamless with the standard vga drivers on a run o da mill vga card 640x480 , i decided that i wanted to edit a copy of a quote that i wanted to add to my . finger . but since i have learned not to really trust seamless , i fired up a full screen winos 23 . 1 session . whoops , the download finished while winos 2 was loading . it had just gotten the pointer up , so i hit alt escape to get back t the desktop i have a lot of fonts , so loading takes a good long while .  blam . screen trashed , procomm hangs up . hm . well , i can sorta see the mouse , so i clicked on the minimized winos 2 session and got back my fullscreen windows session but the color were off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys . so i closed this , and got back to the desktop now fully restored . pp was still sitting , window open , but it was no longer connected to the com port so i exited it the normal way it told me i was still online and it would hang up , though it was already hung up . hm . well , load anothe no , bad idea . shutdown and reboot . ok , refresh first . now , shutdown . yes , everything is closed . hm . nothing seems to be happening . let's see . ah , the windows list still comes up . ok , let's try shutdown again . no go . huh . alright , wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow . hmm . still seems to be running os 2 . try shutdown again . nothing . oh well . reboot . enjoy the checkdisk time .  in this case , a part of the os crashed not only itself , but os 2 entirely which isn not even smart enough to tell when it ; s been compromised , i guess . in everyday specifically today use . os 2 gives each windows app a vdm and they can not touch each other or generally anything they aren not supposed to have . that's the idea , anyway . in truth , when a program crashes on os 2 , it will bring the system down with it . the programs that would just gpf under windows do the same under os 2 , but programs that are fine under dos and windows bring os 2 screaming to a halt , task protection or no. for instance , i m still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp 5 . 1 dos locks up my system . it works fine under dos or even in a dos box under windows 3 . 1 . admittedly , it doesn not crash if i run wp51 full screen , but the first time this bug big me , it bit hard . if windows works for you , then great . maybe this is why some people don not see why os 2 is the os of choice . if windows doesn not crash on you , and you don not mind waiting on each task , please explain . the only time i wait on anything under windows is when i m copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing and even then , not long i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per minute , and can still go do things slowly while it's doing this i have downloaded with pp 9600 while printing . and not being able to adress your memory better than dos , not sure what you mean here . os 2 sees 16 megs , uses 5 or six of these for it's own use more if you want to count winos 2 . windows sees 16 megs , uses 3 or 4 more like 5 if you count the disk cache as i am for os 2 for itself . if memory efficiency were a big issue , pc geos would be the current king of the intel desktop . some of the key reasons for using os 2 are gone . i probably would still use it , but it would be more of an even fight . on the other hand . i am finally able to say with some confidence that both os 2 and windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to them . for instance , the machine i am sitting at runs both fine , while the machine next to me constantly locks up under windows . but ran os 2 without a hitch once i got it through a 5 crash install . on the whole , i would say os 2 is a whole lot more sensitive than windows , but there are i suppose machines that windows just doesn not like . wittism of th week i think that it's wrong to believe in an ism , you should believe in yourself ferrish bueller  wasn not this ferris bueller ?  there are stupid laws , and then there are stupider than normal laws .
3			key	optimization			 clipper considered harmful  the clipper chip's user key is formed by  r1 e d e n1 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 r2 e d e n2 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 r3 e d e n3 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1  why is the triple encrytion used ? is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch ? if so , why use 80 bit keys ? not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm , it's not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess s1 , s2 .  why are n1 , n2 , and n3 formed as they are ? it would be facinating to see the skipjack algorithm , to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way .  where do the 34 bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form n1 , n2 , n3 come from ? are they changed from chip to chip , or session to session ? even if they are published in the ny times , if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks , when using triple encryption , then there's no break in security . but why allow that kind of weird format ? if those three 34 bit values are truly random bits , then maybe it's used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack , if it exists , can not be easily used to derive s1 and s2 for a whole production run of these chips .  does dorothy denning read this group ? if not , is someone on the group forwarding questions like these to her , or martin hellman , or anyone else who's seen more details about the chip ?  john kelsey
2			car	motorcycle	racing	brake	speed	engine			 integra gsr i would like to add the beretta gtz as a car which will kick gs r butt anyday , and it's a lot cheaper to boot  i will take this one with a definate grain of salt . performance data shows a  if this poster has some proof other than my friend blew one away last week   want proof ? here is some data on acceleration and handling from motor trend apr 93 .  integra gs r beretta gtz  0 60 7 . 7 7 . 7 1 4 mile 16 . 0 88 . 1 16 . 1 87 . 8 l acc g's . 84 . 86 slalom 63 . 7 68 . 4 wrong why don not you look again at motor trend's , slalom times , they are 67 . 9 , right along with the integra , and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that are all weather xgtv4 , not to mention that the integra rides alot better than a beretta . your acceleartion times also vary , magazine to magazine road & track and car& driver have the gs r at 6 . 8 to 8 . 0 for road and track . also quarter mile times vary from 15 . 4 to 16 . 1 you can not tell exactly by the numbers . furthermore , the integra will definately outrun the beretta on the high end . car & driver and road & track have the gs r doing 136 to 141 mph , and it gets there fast so , the beretta can out handle the integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration . and the beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage 160 117 hp torque for the integra vs . 180 160 for the beretta . you always believe those exact numbers , why don not you drive a gs r , and see for your self , while the gs r has a low 117 torqye , its high gearing over a 8000 rpm make up for the difference still wouldn not call it a torque moster though ! the biggest advantage would have to be the price . the integra costs $ 19 , 111 as tested motor trend , the gtz costs $ 16 , 134 as tested . the gtz also has standard nicities and airbag and antilock brakes . an airbag is not available on the integra and lower models do not have abs . considering you save almost $ 3 , 000 dollars for the beretta , and the quad4 is a reliable engine , it doesn not make sense to get the integra as a performance coupe , which is what people have been trying to make it out to be .  quad 4 reliable , yeah , what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable , then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect not to mention , a hell of alot smoother and quieter balance shafts . the acura has the engine wins the reliablity contest hands down . you can rev that car all day , everyday , and you will never blow a hose , or crack the block , or anything else . i speak from expierence ! i m not saying the quad 4 is a bad engine , but don not highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine . and while the integra costs alot more , it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better . and does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time . note this isn not a flame on the gtz , or other gm quad 4 products . the berreta is a nice car , and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention , it has an airbag . but to start quoting figures from one source , isn not too reliable . read other sources , and drive both cars . while i haven not driven a gtz , i have driven gts , and grand ams with quad 4 engines , so they are similair .

1						 viewing postscript files under x windows  ow 3 . 0 is the same . but , the definition of broken is relative . pageview requires dsc compliant postscript files , in order to stop at page breaks . i don not consider that broken . i say that any program that puts out a postscript file that isn not dsc compliant is broken .  well that may be true . however , the man page for pageview for ow 2 . 0 does not mention about dsc compliance . in any event , the point here is that if you try to display some ps files using pageview you will find out that it's not a practical tool . it is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need to be dsc compliant . that is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing at sun . i was informed by a sun employee that the pageview program does require dsc compliant postscript . there was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn not dsc compliant that it would stop at each showpage . i believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file , i.e . you could only go forward to the next showpage . this isn not in ow3 . 0 pageview , but maybe it is in the solaris 2 . x version of ow ow 3 . 1 ? in any event , i find pageview extremely useful . since all of the postscript that i produce is dsc compliant , i don not have any problems.  harvard ucbvax ! uwvax ! astroatc ! ftms ! brown or uu2 . psi . com ! ftms ! brown rutgers internet or ftms ! brown

2			canada	montreal	detroit	hockey	seattle	football	vancouver	toronto			 wings will win  it's true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before quinn came , but in those years the smythe division was a lot i mean a lot tougher division than the norris , also known as the snorris , division . vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary , both very legitimate stanley cup contenders , eight times a year , while detroit got to play such powerhouses as toronto and minnesota . now , edmonton is hardly even a force in the league , and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks , while them thar's fighting words . hardly a force . geez . miss the playoffs once in 15 years , and even after making the final four 3 times in the last five years , and everyone thinks its doomsville . over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving , so was everybody in the norris except st louis . detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division . they had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the norris .  bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent . for really good players , they had yzerman , burr , and probert , and that was about it . and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good . the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans . the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers , who , at least at first , got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team . then , even his coaching began to degrade .  fedorov , primeau , kozlov , lidstrom , sillinger , konstantinov , drake , kennedy , racine , and cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to devellano . murray inherited these guys . in addition to yzerman , probert , carson , chiasson , etc. there are a number of reasons why detroit wasn not in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc . was when quinn took over , some of which i outlined above , but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn , with the exception of yzerman . and one player cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender , as i m sure everyone reading this will agree .  no . quinn had far less . murray took over detroit at a time to take advantage of all of devellano's good drafting . if devellano had not given in to demers request to make the oates trade , he might still be gm . gerald

5			jesus	faith	religion	christianity	christ	christian	god			 some questions from a new christian hi , i am new to this newsgroup , and also fairly new to christianity . i was raised as a unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic , but recently i have developed the firm conviction that the christian message is correct and i have accepted jesus into my life . i am happy , but i realize i am very ignorant about much of the bible and quite possibly about what christians should hold as true . this i am trying to rectify by reading the bible of course , but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation commentary on the bible or other relevant aspects of the christian faith . one of my questions i would like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person ? i have another question i would like to ask . i am not yet affiliated with any one congregation . aside from matters of taste , what criteria should one use in choosing a church ? i don not really know the difference between the various protestant denominations . thanks for reading my post sincerely , steve hoskins aside from a commentary , you might also want to consider an introduction . these are books intended for use in undergraduate bible courses . they give historical background , discussion of literary styles , etc. and generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading . i typically recommend kee , froehlich and young's nt introduction . there are also some good one volume commentaries . they often have background articles that are helpful . probably the best recommendation these days would be harper's bible commentary . i think there may be a couple of books with this title . this is a fairly recent one , like about 1990 , done in cooperation with the society for biblical criticism . if you are committed to inerrancy , you will probably prefer something more conservative . i don not read a lot of conservative books , but a commentary i looked at by donald guthrie looked rather good . he has a nt introduction , and he's also editor of eerdman's bible commentary . clh

5			satan	jesus	sin	religion	christianity	islam	christian	god			 islam satanic ? dear fellow christians , i had a dinner last night with a bible study group which i am in . we had a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam . and i was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that mohammad was indeed a prophet but of satan . i said , what ? i did not believe that , because i have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice , even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them in my point of view , they don not sin as much as i do . how come if they were under satan , they could have such personalities . to tell you the truth , i don not know much about islam . but i know that they believe in god , they believe in the day of judgement .  now i m asking you what your opinions about islam and its teaching . important i do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not . i do not want to discuss about politic related to islam . p . s i post this in bit . listserv . christia , soc . religion . christian , and bit . listserv . catholic . in christ , our lord , smile . jesus loves you . tabut torsina  let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam , since there's a group for that . but i suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about islam . indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules , since the question of whether non christians are saved is at the heart of it . the classic christian view , which i think most people believed until the last century or so , was that christianity and of course judaism was the only religion founded by god , and that all other religions worshipped false gods , and came from satan . this is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christians and possibly jews will be saved . this need not mean that there's no truth in any other religion , nor that all of their members are intentionally satanic . after all , in order to be an effective snare , satanic alternatives would have to be attractive . thus they might contain all kinds of truth , wisdom and spiritual insights . they would be missing only one thing knowledge of salvation through christ if this is the background of your teacher's remarks and i suspect it is that means that a discussion of islam is not necessarily relevant . the point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with it . it may teach a fine code of behavior , and its practitioners may all be wonderful people . but if salvation requires being a follower of christ , it could still be a satanic invention . this is a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position . christianity says that salvation isn not a matter of being kind and nice . those are good things , and we should encourage them . but no one is able to do them enough to be saved . salvation requires christ please forgive me for doing this in protestant terms. there's a catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications , but in different terms. a religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways . but if it doesn not have christ , it's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful , tastes great , but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying . let me be clear that i am not specifically advocating this position . what i m trying to do is as usual to clarify issues . indeed it is now relatively uncommon for christians to believe that all other religions are satanic . most christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past this is part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental god . christians now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell , and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to christianity . whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves . clh

5			scientology	homosexuality	conversion	denial			 ex gays ? follow up return path amail . amdahl . com ! i would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post in retrospect i would also like to quote another source douglas c . haldeman from his 1991 book homosexuality therapy ineffective recently the founders of yet another prominent ex gay ministry , exodus international , denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective . michael busse and gary cooper , cofounders of exodus international and lovers for 13 years , were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979 . the program was described by these men as ineffective . not one person was healed . they stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees ; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed reparative therapy . the previous article quoted in the last posting is from the advocate , june 30 , 1992 called the ex ex gay by robert pela . some personal thoughts it is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks . this was the momentum behind the spanish inquisition , only all they required was a confession of faith after much torture and then , to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death . even later , the bible was used vigorously to defend slavery , oppression and segragation of african americans , even to the justification of lynchings . today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach . the tool is still coersion , but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control , convincing people that they should see themselves as less than god sees them , then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind conditioning is complete . sure , no one is physically forced to stay in this reparative therapy but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self hate . as an abolitionist i advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life . a person should be judged by the contibution , or non contribution to the society in which they live , not by some high brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven ; t a clue what is in their heart . for those who seek more information about gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of pflag parents & friends of lesbians and gays who will be more than happy to assist you . this is a group of people comprised of gays , lesbians and bisexuals , their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding . try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some first hand real life and loving understanding . god's love and understanding for gay people is no less abundant . thank you . pax
5			jesus	religion	theology	christianity	bible	scripture	god			 deuterocanonicals , esp . sirach that last paragraph just about killed me . the deuterocanonicals have always been accepted as inspired scripture by the catholic church , which has existed much longer than any protestant church out there . it was martin luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to remove certain books not the fact that the catholic church decided to add some much later that is the reason for the difference between catholic and protestant bibles . this is misleading , at best the question , really , has to do with the status of the greek septuagint versus hebrew scripture . and the issue predates the reformation by quite a bit jerome was negative about the deuteroncanonicals and in fact , even though he transalted them , he put them after the hebrew canon reordered from the greek ordering to the hebrew one . his translations of them were quick and dirty , also he reports having done one of them in one day , and another overnight , just dictating his translation to an amanuensis . that is to say , it is the vulgate , and all of its massive importance in western christianity , along with the veneration of jerome , which took the first steps in reducing these books from the status they had and have among the greeks . furthermore , it is inaccurate to say that the reformers threw out these books . basically , they just placed them in a secondary status as jerome had already done , but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these alone . i think that the emphasis on the hebrew originals is sound , though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection in hebrew or greek are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident . it also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow more inspired as if magical , and conveying a message untranslatable than a translation , as if we could not hear god's word to the jews in greek or german , or english , . this tendency seems to have got a big boost in sola scriptura protestantism , even to the point of current inerrancy bizarreness , despite the more basic , underlying tendency of the reformers to see that the texts should and could be translated . if we can profit from an english rendering of hebrew and greek , there is surely little reason to keep sirach , at least , out of our bibles and of course , anglicans don not do so . for texts originally in greek , it would seem more to be anti greek prejudice notably , by the time the hebrew canon is fully attested , including anti christian prejudice which led to the jewish abandonment of the septuagint which is operative . btw readers may enjoy some lectures of bruce metzger on the issues of translation of the bible including some of what i said about jerome , above in the current numbers of the journal bibliotheca sacra ; two of four have been published so far .  michael l . siemon i say you are gods , sons of the most high , all of you ; nevertheless or you shall die like men , and fall like any prince . psalm 82 6 7

5			woman	religion	sex	islam	prostitution	gender			 muslim tithe ; sexism in genesis 2 according to , muslims tithe 1 6 of their income . perhaps there are some offshoots of islam that impose this on their followers . but the standard tithe is 1 40 of one's net worth , once a year . the same writer also objects to the bible for teaching that woman was created after man , to be his helper etc. this is presumably a reference to genesis 2 . suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed . we have god creating woman , and then saying , it is not good that woman should be alone . i will make a help meet for her . feminists would be outraged . the clear implication would be that god had started at the bottom and worked up , making first the plants , then the fish and birds , then the beasts , then woman , and finally his masterpiece , the male chauvinist pig . the statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself , that she needs a man to open doors for her , would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult . the fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general , while the creation of the man was given in six times the number of words , would have been cited as evidence of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes . the verdict would have been unequivocal . no self respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide , or as anything but sexist trash ! i suggest that moses , fearing this reaction , altered his original draft and described the creation with adam first and then eve , so as to appease miriam and other radical feminists of the day . for some reason , however , it did not work . yours , james kiefer

5			moral	violence	morality	faith	religion	ethic	god			 after 2000 years , can we say that christian morality is  do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates the use of force ?  with a few provisos , yes . minimum force , for a start . and , it depends on what is being forced on either side .  or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such people out of necessity or self defence , while recognizing that our own actions in doing so are not moral ?  my opinion is that our actions would be moral , and it would be immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective . again , there many caveats and provisios .  note , my usage of my opinion is an admission that i don not have a lock on morals , not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on . you are admitting a lot more than that . you are admitting that your morals are situational . you are admitting that the actions of other people and the situation you are in help to determine how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions . if you employ x degree of force , that's not moral , but if you employ x degree of force , but previously someone else has employed y degree of force , and the situation is thus and so , that is moral . this is quite different from saying employing force on other people is immoral , period . unfortunately , from time to time we are obliged to do this immoral thing for reasons of self preservation , and so we have to bear the moral consequences of that . for what it's worth and yes , i know you claim to be an agnostic it's this ability to re label things from immoral to moral that i find one of the least attractive qualities of the religious mind . jon .

3			secrecy			 keeping your mouth shut was hard drive security  i m not a lawyer , so correct me if i m wrong , but doing that could be considered obstruction of justice , which could land you in prison for quite a while .  the thing that's great about the secret key is it is idea encrypted , so even if the fbi do get the key , they are sol unless they know the magic word if they try to force you to give them your pass phrase , just say oops , i forgot . since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution in this country , if you keep your mouth shut , how can they prove that you didn not forget your pass phrase .   well , i m no lawyer , but i will supply some ancedotal evidence which may change your mind . note i do not agree at all with what went on in this case , and neither will most of you . that doesn not change the fact that it did happen . right here in america even .  about three or four years ago , there was a rather nasty custody case in or around washington d . c . the upshot was , an ex husband was suing for visitation rights , which were granted . the woman believed that the man had been sexually molesting her children . much like allen farrow , but not as famous . anyhows , she spirits away the kids and refuses to tell the court where they are , and denies him visitation rights .  she keeps her mouth shut , and what happens ? she sits in jail for almost a year , on contempt of court , until the legislature passes a special law limiting the time a person can be held . if they hadn not passed the law , she would most likely still be there . the kids were in new zealand , i belive .  now story finished , commetary starting . imho , the only reason the legislature moved was because there was an outpouring of public sympathy for this woman . most people believed she was right , and were outraged . not likely to happen for joe random drug dealer , child molester or perfectly innocent privacy lover , who might have something to hide . innocent until proven guilty doesn not mean you get to walk out of court humming a happy tune because the fbi can not read your disk . just ask those held for contempt , those who can not make bail , etc , etc.  again . i disagree totally with the concept of holding someone based on suspicion , but people who keep thinking that it won not happen are bound to get a rude shock when it does .  also not a lawyer , etc. but if i remember correctly the contempt of court business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is perhaps questionably , different issue the legitimate business of that court . quite literally the party is found guilty of holding the court in contempt . now , the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if certain threatening conditions are met . once the key is gone there is no question of contempt of court as there is nothing to compell , the key is no longer there to be produced . obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes however extenuated i think that this charge would be a hard nut to make . perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up ?   vincent a . kub , wd0dbx saints should always be judged guilty until they are proven innocent . geo . orwell  14 w . cherry st 2 it is good to die before one has vermillion , s . dakota 57069 done anything deserving of death . phone or fax to 605 624 8680 anaxandirdes king of sparta  begin pgp public key block version 2 . 2 mqbnaiudo1maaaecakrkuuww tqsoa1nd gasbpxcdhsrhpmebpjklyikuijzat6 auo hnqw 652yicvajlxspb5d2gimc09tg2sgy0abrg0cvzpbmnliet1yg iuub end pgp public key block

4			gun	violence	killing	crime	murder			 gun control was re we are mad as hell at the tv news frank crary posted sure , but the difference in per capita crime rates predates the gun control laws the homicide rate in england was a tenth that of america , back when anyone in england could buy a gun without any paperwork at all . steve manes asks got a citation for this ? colin greenwood from scotland yard did a study that showed that gun control has had no effect on crime or murder rates in the uk . his book , firearms controls , has been published in london by keegan paul name may be misspelled . others dispute that , like richard hofstadter , america as a gun culture , and newton and zimring's firearms and violence in american life . but , again , statistics between too dissimilar cultures are difficult to quantify . i don not know how anyone can state that gun control could have no effect on homicide rates . there were over 250 accidental handgun homicides in america in 1990 , most with licensed weapons . more american children accidentally shot other children last year 15 than all the handgun homicides in great britain . source national safety council . please . no dictionary arguments about rates vs total numbers , okay ? they are offered for emphasis , not comparison . if mr. greenwood believes that brits are much too sober and coordinated to make such mistakes i would like to introduce him to my friend , amanda from brighton . i used to have some pretty nice crystal in my place until she moved in . i have gotten used to the snide comments from guests about the clown motif on my rubber wine glasses .  stephen manes manes and associates new york , ny , usa o& o

5			morality	faith	religion	ethic	christianity	theory	skepticism			 after 2000 years , can we say that christian morality is this is swf in another indirect post via dan .  the same way that any theory is proven false . you examine the predicitions that the theory makes , and try to observe them . if you don not , or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn not happen , then you have some evidence against the theory . if the theory can not be modified to incorporate the new observations , then you say that it is false .  but how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment ? in many types of experiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again and be capable of being observed . for example , in chemistry someone may predict the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction repeatedly . there are several problems here . first , you are discussing only experimental procedures . observational procedures are also useful . the main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as yet unmade observations . the observations could be the result of an experiment , or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature , or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past all that matters is that the observations be new . this is what prediction is about in science it is not about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense . secondly , repeatability can also take many forms. it is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results . the observation of a fossil is are peatable , since any qualified observer may look at it this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum . also , there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one . new fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly . many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils . unfortunately for you , the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have . for instance , the front legs of tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles , rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed . so , in fact , histoircal science findings are repeatable in the necessary sense . just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the original event does not make it impossible to make valid observations . this is not to say that biologists would not go coo coo if extra terrestrial life were discovered that could make the determination of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy .  formerly tdatirv ! sarima or formerly tdatirv ! sarima or

5			hell	mythology	demon	god	heaven			 hell in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words translated into the word hell . these greek words have totally different meanings . the words are hades , tartaros , and gehenna . in bibical usage , the greek word hades is used only 11 times in the new testament , and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol . meaning the grave or pit compare acts 2 27 with psalms 16 10 . hades may be likened to a hole in the ground . in the bible it has nothing to do with fire ! most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice . why ? because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever burning inferno , when this was never remotely intended in the greek language or in old english ! in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead , but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of shadowy realm . hades is simply the abode we call the grave . all dead go to this hell . the second hell of the bible , tartaros , is mentioned only once in scripture , 2 pet . 2 4 ; for if god spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell tartaros , and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment . following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne isa . 14 12 14 ; rev . 12 4 , the archangel lucifer now satan and a third of the created angels now demons were ejected from heaven luke 10 18 . they were cast down to tartaros , a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment jude 6 ; 1 cor . 6 3 . tartaros , then , is a hell that applies only to evil , rebellious angels or demons it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans . nowhere in the bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell . the the third word that is translated as hell in the bible is gehenna . it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom , meaning valley of hinniom . hinnom is a deep , narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem . in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites , including infant sacrifice it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made their children pass through the fire to the god molech . the rites were specifically celebrated in tophet , the place of abhorrence , one of the chief groves in the valley . king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations . he defiled the valley , rendering it ceremonially unclean 2 kings 23 10 . later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem ; a repository for sewage , refuse and animal carcasses . the bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish . fires burned continuously , feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse . aceldama , the field of blood , purchased with the money judas received for the betrayal of christ matt . 27 8 was also in part of the valley of hinnom . so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell ? in rev . 19 20 the satan inspired political dictator and a miracle working religious figure , the false prophet , working with him will resist the re establishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming . their fate is revealed by the apostle john and the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet . these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .  where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be ? the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast for tophet in the valley of hinnom is ordained of old , yea for the king it is prepared , he hath made it deep and large , the pile thereof is fire and wood , the breath of the lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it isa . 30 33 . one thousand years later , satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast ! rev . 20 10 . but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia ? does the bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire ? in the sequence of rev . 20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there ! rev . 20 15 . what will become of these wicked ? will they writhe in flames for eternity ?  the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna fire on the earth . they wil be consumed , annihilated , destroyed ! this punishment will be everlasting permanent and final . the bible calls it the second death rev . 20 14 ; 21 8 , from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection . the bible does teach eternal punishment , but not eternal punishing .  the prophet malachi provides a graphic description . for , behold , the day cometh that shall burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble , and the day that cometh shall burn them up . 4 1 . to the righteous , god says that the wicked shall be ashes under the soles of your feet . mal . 4 3 . gehenna was a place of destruction and death , not a place of living torture ! jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or valley of hinnom . utter destruction by fire was complete . nothing was left , but ashes !  every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means complete destruction , not living torture not eternal life in torment ! the bible says , in romans 6 23 , the wages of sin is death , not eternal life in torture . the punishment revealed in the bible is death . the cessation of life .  eternal life is the gift of god !

3			weight			 metric vs english si neatly separates the concepts of mass , force and weight which have gotten horribly tangled up in the us system .  this is not a problem with english units . a pound is defined to be a unit of force , period . there is a perfectly good unit called the slug , which is the mass of an object weighing 32 . 2 lbs at sea level . g 32 . 2 ft sec 2 , of course .  american military english units , perhaps . us real english types were once taught that a pound is mass and a poundal is force being that force that causes 1 pound to accelerate at 1 ft . s 2 . we had a rare olde tyme doing our exams in those units and metric as well . american , perhaps , but nothing military about it . i learned mostly slugs when we talked english units in high school physics and while the teacher was an ex navy fighter jock the book certainly wasn not produced by the military . poundals were just too flinking small and made the math come out funny ; sort of the same reason proponents of si give for using that .  insisting on perfect safety is for people who don not have the balls to live in the real world . mary shafer , nasa ames dryden  i don not speak for others and they don not speak for me .

4			politics	putin	america	russian	russia			 top ten reasons not to aid russians i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti west slogans coming from his opponents in the russian congress . i sure know who i want to back .  could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun ? if we had backed him strongly early on i doubt there would be the problem there is now . many russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt , rightly imo , that the west didn not care . yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid once bush got over his gorby mania . this probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections . well , the aid didn not come through and we didn not make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding .  have you considered a non interventionist policy ? if market reform does happen , russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy . they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason . if they don not reform , then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them . if they don not reform i don not believe in giving them money . however , i think this is too important to take a non interventionist approach . this is what really bugs me about libertarianism it sounds like it will all be the same in a hundred years time . no need to do anything .   how does this affect us ? well , we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of europe are blown away i think we would feel something . a massive breakup of a country that spans 1 6th the planet is bound to have affects here . of course , there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies or struggling democracies .  if a $ 1 . 6 billion gift was that important to our well being , couldn not it be raised voluntarilly ? people already give over $ 100 billion a year to charity . despite the wishes of libertarians , this society is a far way , and getting farther , from being libertarian . perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it . we have to face the problem now , not in x years when we have a libertarian dream society . right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade , let alone charity . there are still limitations to high tech exports . nasa can not buy proton launch vehicles from them . sure , the market may be able to help a great deal but it can not right now . there are too many obstacles . instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face .  seriously . everyone has different opinions on what is stupid . my two causes are aid to russia and a strong space program . someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish . that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy . instead of gridlock on a massive scale , we only have gridlock on a congressional scale .  it seems instead of gridlock on any scale , we have aid to russia , expensive space programs , national charity that doesn not help the poor , and probably , studies of drunken goldfish . i think limited government is more key than how democratic it is . well , i think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited . but the main question is how do you transform a state run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours ? btw , sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction it is not going to be painless and not going to be easy . we simply cannot wait to help when they have the proper government . they will never get there without the aid . it may be too late already .  btw , who is to decide 'stupid ? this is just like those who want to impose their morals on others just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against  that was an opinion , and libertarians are very big on free speech . and i m just excercising mine .  actually , my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party . it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim .  if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be very libertarian . consider it a compromise . how much money would your fellow russia aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose weren not using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you don not support ? as i also said above , another problem i have is with transformation . a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight . i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self sufficient populace .  we could do that 100 years ago but not now .  people have been saying that for hundreds of years . they didn not have nuclear weapons 100 years ago . nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day .  like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making .  all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information , than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues . yes , depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses . rulers do emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet . there must be checks and balances . checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds . putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is , to me , just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of government .  julie disclaimer all opinions here belong to my cat and no one else

4			politics	democracy	war	truth	journalism			 israel does not kill reporters . anas omran has claimed that , the israelis used to arrest , and sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters . the assertion by anas omran is , of course , a total fabrication . if there is an once of truth iin it , i m sure anas omran can document such a sad and despicable event . otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth . if omran would care to retract this error i would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar . if he can document such a claim , i would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar . failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is .

3			vision	pain	cancer	surgery			 seeking info on retinal detachment i am quite near sighted . i have recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment . in my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to weld this back in place as well . my right eye seems fine . in my left eye i was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment . since the treatment two weeks these flashes are now occuring more often several each hour . the opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it . he says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord if it tugs enough i may well face retinal detachment . i am seeking via sci . med additional info on retinal detachments . the dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so i appreciate any further details anyone can provide . of most interest to me if my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action ? if conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can i expect afterwards . do the symptoms fairly frequent flashes imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm . many thanks bill  bill wilder , computer systems manager kentville research station agriculture canada kentville , nova scotia

5			time	prophecy	god			 revelations now , as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical , can you elaborate ? i m not exactly sure what you mean . how does the suggestion relate to isaiah's prophecy of the birth of christ by a virgin ? i don not see any cycles in that prophecy .  maybe cyclical is not the best word .  another example would be the scripture quoted of judas , and his bishoprick let another take . another example is something that isaiah said of his disciples which is also applied to christ in hebrews , the children thou hast given me .  how does the preterist view account for this phenomenon . ah , double fulfillment . first of all i would say that i m not sure all the prophecies had double fulfillment , e.g . the isaiah 7 14 prophecy . i would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always , especially with regard to nt prophecies . the apostles who quoted the ot and applied those passages to jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant word of god to the church . no one has that authority today . no one has the apostolic authority to say that such and such a prophecy has double fulfillment . if the imagry of revelation fits with events of the 1st century , it is folly for us to try and make it apply to events 20 centuries later .  tom albrecht
3			diabetes	bacteria	cancer	nutrition	antibiotic			 diet for crohn's ibd  one thing that i haven not seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids fas .  i was diagnosed last may w crohn's of the terminal ileum . when i got out of the hospital i read up on it a bit , and came across several studies investigating the role of epa an essentially fa in reducing inflammation . the evidence was mixed . many of these studies are discussed in inflammatory bowel disease , macdermott , stenson . 1992 .  but if i recall correctly , there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies both the ones w pos . and w neg . results . in the studies patients were given epa a few grams day for most of the studies , but , if i recall correctly , there was no restriction of the other fas that the patients could consume . from the informed layperson's perspective , this seems mistaken . if lots of n 6 fas are consumed along with the epa , then the ratio of bad prostanoid products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad . isn not this ratio the issue ?  what's the view of the gastro . community on epa these days ? epa supplements , along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat 8 10 calories .  brian as you note , the research is mixed , so there is no consensus on the role of fatty acids in ulcerative colitis . there is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed short is butyrate and shorter . there may be a role for treatment of uc with short chain fatty acids , and i am looking forward to the upcoming aga meeting in boston to see what people are doing . you raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids . you should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor it is a good point . by the way , the abbreviation epa is not in general use , so i do not know what fatty acid you are speaking about . and to brian an u of c there is a physician named stephen hanauer there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of ibd . you might give him a call . he is interested in new combinations of drugs for the treatment of ibd . if you call please say hello to him from me , i was looking at u of c for a position , and perhaps still am . and be sure to look into joining the ccfa . best of luck . steve holland

3			emotion	sci	people	schizophrenia			 great post ! was re candida yeast bloom . very long warning , lots of words in typical phlegmatic fashion great post martin . very informative , well balanced , and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor . cross posted to alt . psychology . personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning note i have set all followups to sci . med since most of my comments are more sci . med oriented and i m sure most of the replies , if any , will be med related . i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed . steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci . med . nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible , steve , and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well . they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs . oops , that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community , better not say that since it therefore must not , and never will , exist actually , it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs system , just email me and i will send a summary file to you . in the general population , nt's comprise only about 12 of the population , but among physicians it is much much higher i don not know the exact percentage any help here a . p . p . er's ? one driving characteristic of an nt , especially an ntj , is their obvious choleric behavior driver , type a , etc. the extreme emotional need to control , to lead , and or to be the best or the most competent . if they are also extroverted , they are best described as field marshalls . this trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead , to strive to overcome the elements , to seek and thirst for knowledge , to raise the level of competency , etc. the great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically minded approach t trait of the nt personality of course , the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well . however , when the nt person has self image challenges , the dark side of this personality type usually comes out , which should be obvious to all . a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling , and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question . i have known many m . d . 's of this temperament and suffice to say i don not oblige them with a followup visit , no matter how competent i think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most , to know it all . maybe we need more nf doctor's . enough on this subject let's move on to candida bloom . let me tell you who the quacks really are , these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics . could it just be professional jealousy ? i couldn not help elaine or jon but somebody else did . you have helped me already by your post of course , i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis , but being the phlegmatic i am , maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts . let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent . . humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth , stomach , small and large intestine , sinuses , vagina and on the skin . these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised . they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease , they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body . but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body . a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier . in my well described situation in prior posts , i definitely was immune stressed . blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low . my sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged . i also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years ! in the end , even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans , mucus color won not get into the details , and other symptoms. three very traditional ent's made this diagnosis i did not have any cultures done , however , because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection . enough of this background provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungal therapy below . the first question i have is this . can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue , maybe via hyphae , thus causing symptoms , without being considered 'systemic in the classic sense ? it is sort of an inbetween infection . steve got real upset with elaine's doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems. if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body , he would not or at least should not be calling elaine's doctor a quack . i was concerned , too , because of the toxicity of vitamin a . my doctor , after my blood tests , put me on 75 , 000 iu of vitamin a for one week only , then dropped it down to 25 , 000 iu for the next couple of weeks . i also received zinc and other supplementation , since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he's one of those evil orthomolecular specialists . i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal , he then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement , and made sure that i maintain a 50 , 000 iu day of beta carotene . call me carrot face . hopefully , elaine's doctor will take a similar , careful approach and to all supplements . i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking , for example , niacin in fairly large dosages , 1 gram day , which steve dyer had good information about on sci . med . nutrition . if niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies , then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage . survives . if it gets access to a lot of glucose , it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses , gi tract or vagina . in though i do now believe , based on my successful therapy with sporanox , that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses , i still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis ? my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox , but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal . btw , my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry , can not remember which one , and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms. i will have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion . some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site . whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn not certain . my doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans , and i showed a strong positive . another question , would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless ? and , assuming it is true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue , and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount , could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms , such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response ? as i said in an earlier post , one does not need to be a rocket scientist , or have a m . d . degree or a ph . d . in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis . btw , and i will repost this again . dr. ivker , in his book , sinus survival , has routinely given , before anything else , nizoral a pre sporanox systemic anti fungal , not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years . he claims that out of 2000 or so patients , well over 90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms , but it doesn not cure it by any means , implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause , but a later complication . he's also found that nystatin , whether taken internally , or put into a sinus spray , does not help . this implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream . again , i admit , lots of ifs , and implies , which doesn not please the hard core nt who has to have the double blind study or it's a non issue , but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation , a strawman , if you will . if it's internal , only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript . this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done . and that is if you can not observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus , then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease . and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body . it's a real catch 22 . another catch 22 those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done , but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is , from their perspective , a non study which should not even be considered . i agree that the appropriate studies should be done , and that will take big $ to do it right . however , in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets , you literally have to give them evidence , and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding . that is , you have to do 90 of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a national lab , i m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects . i m afraid that even if dr. ivker and 100 other doctors got together , pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture , and approach the funding agencies , they would get nowhere , even if they were able to publish their statistical results . it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist , and is not even a tenable hypothesis , so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind , and not only that , they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not , will not , and cannot exist period . kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint . kind of reminds me of lister . candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses , the gi tract mouth , stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food . the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier . if they do , an inflammatory response will be set up . most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets . about 30 of all american's die with less vitamin a than they were born with u.s. autopsy studies . while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system . this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom . aren not there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia ? while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned . while drugs are available to handle candida , many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection . the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution . but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun , then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections , in spite of what mr. steve dyer says . again , the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue , similar to mold growing in bread . you can continue to kill the surface , such as nystatin does , but you can not kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones such as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective . this is why , as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i have been in email contact with thanks , that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasis . it's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away . the $ 60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes , causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e.g . allergy , without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal . in the gi system , the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract . one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear . also , if one is an anal retentive , like i have been diagnosed in a prior post , that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth . if the bloom occurs in the anal area , the burning , swelling , pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids . if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract , very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool . this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place . after extensive testing , he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt . on to another doctor , and so on . richard kaplan has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys ? if my gut hurt me on a constant basis , i would want it fixed . yes it's nice to know that i don not have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress ? when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90 better , steve dyer calls him a quack . as i have said in private email , there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don not work . for example , i went to three ent's , who all said that i will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia , but my ostia weren not plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition . after three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox , body nutrient level monitoring and equalization , vitamin c , lentinen , echinacea , etc . my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago , before my health greatly deteriorated . of course , skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway , but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent's i saw who said that i would just have to live with it . i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure . the anti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years . note for those having sinus problems , may i suggest the book by dr. ivker i mention above . be sure to get the revised edition . . i have often wondered what an m . d . with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome . dr. ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems , and his visits to several ent's totally floored him when they said you will just have to live with it . he spent several years trying everything standard and non standard , until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis . he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it . his one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice . i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say , such as , it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases , to put it mildly . i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient . maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e.g . they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified , should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted . remember , theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other , they are synergistic . if a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients , shouldn not you at least sit up and take notice ? maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn not work . i m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help . you have to do both ; both have to be balanced , which we don not see from some of the posters to this group . there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense , and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues . i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help , so i did the natural thing i went to a couple of doctor's who are somewhat outside this establishment , and as a result i have found significant relief . would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor , without fear of being sued or having his license pulled , can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective ? i would like to hear a doctor tell me well , i have tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country , and since they clearly don not work for you , i now have the authority to use experimental , unproven techniques that seem to have helped others . i can not promise anything , and there are some risks . you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies , and i will have to register your case at the state board anyway , if my ent had suggested this to me , i would have jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who , for either altruistic reasons , or for greed , is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient . such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine , and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free . it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient . it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies , some of which seem to work like my case , and others of which will never work at all true quackery . i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500k in size . if taken orally , it can also become a major bacteria in the gut . through aresol sprays , it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes . but before this innoculation occurs , the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened . this is accomplished by vitamin a , vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins . diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b6 and folate . these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy . what dosage of b6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes ? some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin , published by rodale press , as well as notes from my human nutrition course . i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future , along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms. another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase , this is especially important if the gi system is involved . if candida can not get glucose , it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria , which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy , a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut . i would like to see the role of complex carbohydrates , such as starch . if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post , fine . i jumped all over steve in sci . med . nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut . people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way . those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content . if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone , i wouldn not have a problem with your behavior . brave soul you are . the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity to it . one year ago , my phlegmatic self would have backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis . but my immune system , and my computer system , have been hardened from gradual desensitization . i now kind of like being called anal retentive it has a nice ring to it . i also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the post truly classic , worthy of a blue or maybe brown ribbon . i might even cross post it to alt . bestof . internet . hmmm . martin banschbach , ph . d . professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine thanks again for a great and informative post i hope others who have researched this area and are lurking in the background will post their thoughts as well , no matter their views on this subject . jon noring  charter member infj club . if you are dying to know what infj means , be brave , email me , i will send info .  jon noring jkn international ip 192 . 100 . 81 . 100 fred's gourmet chocolate 1312 carlton place phone 510 294 8153 chips world's best ! livermore , ca 94550 v mail 510 417 4101  who are you ?

4			violence	peace	revenge			 waco survivors 1715 19 april david koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out peacefully sooner or later . the fbi and atf had nothing but time on their hands ! why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy ? their job is to protect the public and save lives not kill people for crying out loud .  koresh had lied and lied and lied about coming out of the compound . to the fbi . to his lawyer . to just about everyone . i keep hearing this , but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two . as far as i am concerned , i am not ready to stipulate that koresh ever promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise . the first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given national exposure . well , it never was it was broadcast locally , in a chopped up fashion , and that's all . and even then , they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded national exposure , but not so cleverly that we didn not hear it . the last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript . we will never know if he would have kept that one . the fbi etc. can not wait forever for koresh to come out . as long as they thought that koresh's intended to surrender peacefully . when they lost hope in that , they decided to go in . strangely enough , the previous day they said they were prepared to wait as long as it takes . further , while the mondays tactics were silly and clumsy , they were obviously intended to drive the davidians out of the compound , not to kill koresh and his followers . quite possible . but arguments of intent do not mark the dividing line between guilt and innocence only the line between murder and negligent manslaughter . if it is true . i read in the paper that the government listening devices inside the compound picked up orders to burn the joint down shortly before the fire was started . i m waiting to see what the tapes really hold . this would be an interesting development . the davidian may be telling the truth , or he may be lying to save his skin from possible murder charges resulting from the blaze . koresh's lawyer , being the attorney for at least one surviving davidian , has an interest in claiming that the gov not caused the fire , at least as much as the gov not has an interest in blaming koresh for the fire . it's the physical evidence that will decide who's telling what . it's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to go state's evidence , parrot the fbi story , hang the whole suicide on koresh , claim they only stayed at gunpoint , etc. if any of them do this in the next few weeks , it doesn not prove much ; but if none of them do , it would be a strong indication to me that the fbi story is dead wrong .  if you believe that i speak for my company , or write today for my special investors packet .

5			religion	ethic	islam	jihad	muslim			 yet more rushdie re islamic law  it is my understanding that it is generally agreed upon by the ulema islamic scholars that islamic law applies only in an islamic country , of which the uk is not . furthermore , to take the law into one's own hands is a criminal act , as these are matters for the state , not for individuals . nevertheless , khomeini offered a cash prize for people to take the law into their own hands something which , to my understanding , is against islamic law . yes , this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws . however , i believe there are also certain legal rulings which , in all five schools of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari , can be levelled against muslim or non muslims , both within and outside dar al islam . i do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active , persistent , and open hostility to islam falls into this category of the law . i do know that historically , apostasy has very rarely been punished at all , let alone by the death penalty . my understanding is that khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone . it was well known that rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the qur an , hadith , or in islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy . i believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad . this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals . the reward was not offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran . stuff deleted also , i think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the distribution of the book . my understanding is that khomeini's fatwa was issued in response to the writing and publishing of the book . if my view is correct , then your viewpoint that rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is incorrect .  i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book . however , the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges . i remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa iran stressed that the condemnation of the author , and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis . but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa . islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people , not books . the rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa . rushdie went on a media blitz , presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred . fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book , he was everywhere in the media . then muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book . rushdie appeared momentarily concerned , then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the muslims and defend his sacred rights . it was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued . the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling . the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers . the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well . the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media . ps i m not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad ruling .

2			fear	violence	democracy	murder			 warning . please read . i deleted your name because i don not want to sound accusative in my remark  this is a two sided problem . unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time . the breeding of these low life's is getting worse ; our justice system is at best extremely weak to handle these problems. that is why low abiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is imminent .  my camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back . the persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me ! but not before having trashed the car .  on another occasion , on my way from texas to florida , i had stopped in a small motel for the night in a small town somewhere in florida . about 5 youths were disturbing my car , setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out . when i and another tenant walked out with a 357 magnum and a 45 automatic respectively , they vanished . needless to say , i immediately packed up and left .  watch out for car jacking and staged accidents . they can be deadly !  i m not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons , but i would ask you if you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your alarm ? i can think of worse things in the world . glad you got out of there before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun . we can all ask what's happening to society these days , but don not forget to ask another important question too what effort am i expending to make it any different than it is ? just my thoughts , joe karolchik

5			jesus	religion	christ	angel	god	heaven			 committing my life to god ? hi everyone , i m trying to find my way to god , but find it difficult as i can not hear god talking to me , letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me , and i feel that i can not possibly get to know him until he does . maybe he is talking to me but i just don not know or understand how to listen . some christians tell me that in their opinion the only way to find god is to take a plunge and commit your life to him , and you will discover . this idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening , but i have a few questions . 1 how do you actually commit yourself ? if i just say , ok god , her you go , i m committing my life to you , i wouldn not really feel that he would listened at least , i couldn not be sure that he had . so how does one or how did you commit oneself to god ? 2 in committing myself in this way , what do i have to forfeit of my current life ? what can i no longer do ? i feel that i m as good as many christians , and i try to uphold the idea of loving your neighbour i don not go round killing people , stealing , etc . and i try not to get jealous of other people in any way and i would say that i keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many christians . so what do i have to give up ? 3 when committed , what do i have to do ? what does it involve ? what if any burdens am i taking on ? 4 so then , what's the general difference before and after ? i assume , that like on your birthday you don not suddenly feel a year older it won not suddenly change my life the day i commit myself . so what happens ? 5 how can i be sure that it is the right thing to do ? how can i find out what the it in the last sentence actually is ? thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions . perhaps email would be a better way to reply , but it's up to you . ben . janet 20 year old at university in scotland

5			moral	morality	religion	ethic	christianity	philosophy			 morality ? was re political atheists ?  explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts , and i am happy to listen . for example , if it were instinctive not to murder .  then not murdering would have no moral significance , since there would be nothing voluntary about it .  see , there you go again , saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary . why do you think this ? if you force me to do something , am i morally responsible for it ?  and anyway , humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts . well , make up your mind . is it to be instinctive not to murder or not ?  so , only intelligent beings can be moral , even if the bahavior of other beings mimics theirs ?  you are starting to get the point . mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated . a parrot saying pretty polly isn not necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly .  you are attaching too many things to the term moral , i think . let's try this is it good that animals of the same species don not kill each other . or , do you think this is right ? it's not even correct . animals of the same species do kill one another .  or do you think that animals are machines , and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong ? sigh . i wonder how many times we have been round this loop . i think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance . i am quite prepared to believe that higher animals , such as primates , have the beginnings of a moral sense , since they seem to exhibit self awareness .   animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily , but they don not .  they do . i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this , but you seem to have a very short memory .  those weren not arbitrary killings . they were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot . so what ? are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not ? is this your natural morality  are you trying to say that this isn not an act of morality because most animals aren not intelligent enough to think like we do ?  i m saying there must be the possibility that the organism it's not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives .  it's right there in the posting you are replying to .  yes it was , but i still don not understand your distinctions . what do you mean by consider ? can a small child be moral ? how about a gorilla ? a dolphin ? a platypus ? where is the line drawn ? does the being need to be self aware ? are you blind ? what do you think that this sentence means ? there must be the possibility that the organism it's not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives . what would that imply ?  what do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from arbitrarily killing each other ? don not you find the fact that they don not at all significant ? i find the fact that they do to be significant . jon .

2			marketing	computer			 countersteering faq please post  no no no no ! all i am saying is that you don not even need to tell people the technique of countersteering , cos they will do it intuitively the first time they try to go round a corner . some will , and others will steer with their tuchuses . i don not know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers . i was one , i guess that i always steered a bicycle that way , and i only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding after the course . i could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem , but i only started using it in my normal riding when i decided that my turning at speed off ramps and the like was a lot more difficult that it should have been . i knew how it works although that's currently up for debate definitely knew that it works , as i could do it in swerves , but only figured it out later in my normal riding . just a data point . i think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up , but it's best to let everyone tuchus steer for the first lesson or two , so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique . countersteering . in fact , my experienced rider course instructors claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight around , even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite direction . i admit i have never actually seen this . i have . in our beginner course we had passenger training . sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike , and the student would take him for a ride . if the student did not give the instructor the you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech , the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself . it was amusing to watch , i m just happy that it didn not happen to me . i have bike like jody levine dod 275 kv got a you can if you pf ride it toronto , ontario , canada

5			religion	ethic	christianity	controversy	heresy	god			 easter what's in a name ? was re new testament double stan a lot of stuff deleted for that matter , stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast of first fruits . torah commands that this be observed on the day following the sabbath of passover week . sunday by any other name in modern parlance . why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured ? why jump it all over the calendar the way easter does ? why not just go with the sunday following passover the way the bible has it ? why seek after unbiblical methods ?  in fact , that is the reason easter jumps all over the calendar passsover itself is a lunar holiday , not a solar one , and thus falls over a wide possible span of times . the few times that easter does not fall during or after passover are because easter is further linked to the vernal equinox the beginning of spring . more deletions  so what does this question have to do with easter the whore goddess ? i am all for celebrating the resurrection . just keep that whore out of the discussion .  your obsession with the term whore clouds your argument . whore is a value judgement , not a descriptive term . more deletions overall , this argument is an illustration of the etymological fallacy see j . p . louw semantics of nt greek . that is the idea that the true meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form . in fact , our own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with how it is used , not where it came from . very few modern people would make any connection whatsoever between easter and ishtar . if daniel seagard does , then for him it has that meaning . but that is a highly idiosyncratic meaning , and not one that needs much refutation .

5			morality	faith	religion	ethic	philosophy	reason	truth	atheist	god			 question for those with popular morality i was not directly going to come up with a moral argument for the existence of god . rather , i was trying to show the absurdity of atheistic materialist relatavists trying to embrace some common moral system as though it were absolute . man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong . we have all inherited this knowledge . no matter how absurd it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute , it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible . in fact , for the bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code , it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use . the jewish talmud is the result of centuries of biblical scholars analysing every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it . the children of israel were given a very strict set of moral , civil , judicial and ceremonial laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their society . for a christian , the situation is no better . it seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo christian god is that which is contained in the bible which we can see from the diverse opinions in the christian newsgroups is not clear . there may well be an absolute morality defined by the judeo christian god for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man . this leads to the problem of defining morality for our society . if we take the divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways as an example , consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer justice . if we take an agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society with all the danger that this implies . alternatively , we could take the basis of the judeo christian morality and interpret extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live righteously as many christian and non christian philosophers have done . whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society , i think the important aspect is the result . david .  on religion oh , where is the sea ? the fishes cried , as they swam its clearness through .

2			tennis	boxing	baseball	speed			 jose canseco's swing 1992 vs . 1986 . was going over some videos last night . and you wrote an excellent report about it . 1 . he's bulked up too much . period . he needs to lose about 20 pounds , not gain more bulk .  2 . his bat speed has absolutely vanished . conservatively , i would say he's lost 4 7 of his bat speed , and that's a huge amount of speed .  3 . that open stance is killing him . note that he acts sort of like brian downing way open to start , then closes up as ball is released . downing could do this without significant head movement canseco can not . also , note that canseco doesn not always close his stance the same way sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes , they are fully closed . without a good starting point , it's hard to make adjustments in your swing . i understand from an unreliable source that canseco was considered expendable by the a's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance . the a's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated , if not caused , by having a wide open stance , closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque that's a paraphrase of what i remember . in any event , canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance , and the a's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power . aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch , so that i would never have to work again , i would restructure my entire swing . apparently , you sound like larussa . second , drop 20 pounds . cut out the weight work . the a's also objected about this . if canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems , he will be out of baseball in three years . if not , he could still hit 600 hr . again , i m just repeating something i heard but possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that . the beastmaster  mark singer

5			religion	saint	mary			 st maria goretti heres the life of st maria goretti , posted with kind permission of the editor of the australian catholic magazine morning star . hope you like it . put up with anything to prevent sin st maria goretti maria was born on october 16th 1890 to luigi and assunta goretti , the eldest daughter in the family of seven . she was a cheerful girl , always imitating her parents . she had but one disire , but one wish to receive our lord in the blessed sacrament . the date was finally set for little maria to receive our lord on the feast of corpus christi . for maria , time seemed like an eter nity as she slowly neared the great day . when it finally arrived , fr . jerome the priest who was to celebrate the mass and give the children their first holy communion delivered a sermon on the immense love of jesus christ for them and the great love we should have in return for him . he then warmly urged them to die rather than commit a mortal sin . maria humbly approached the altar of god and received the holy eucharist her only sadness was the thought of her father's absence , who died some time beforehand . as for the rest of the day , maria remained under the spell of the divine visit ; that is until 4 her thoughts changed to when she could go next to holy communion . thus ended the happiest day of maria's life . over the next twelve months , maria had changed from a giggling little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities . as her mother went out into the fields in place of her husband , maria took on the ironing , cooking , washing and other motherly duties . she was doing this not only for her own family , but also for the serenellis , a father and son who lived with the goretti's , owning a share in the farm . although maria was poorer than all the other children , she by far surpassed them in virtue . in all thi ngs she did the holy will of god . during the month of june , alessandro serenelli the son twice made advances upon maria when he chanced to be alone with her . on both occasions maria managed to struggle free of alessandro's strong grip , but on the second , he threatened to kill her if she even uttered a word to her mother . from this day on , maria lived in terror , fearing lest alessandro attack again . on july 5th 1902 , alessandro left work in the fields to get a handkerchief , as he claimed . he went to the storeroom beneath the house where maria , who was outside on the landing with the baby , could hear him fumbling about in with tools . she wondered what he was doing . it was later learned that he was sharpening a 91 2 blade . he went to the house and called for maria . she told him she wouldn not go to him unless she knew why she was needed . he stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room . mar ia instantly realized what he was up to . no , no , no ! do not touch me ! it is a sin , you will go to hell ! at this point alessandro held the knife over maria's chest , who was now on the floor . will you or will you not ? maria gathered all her energy . no i will not , alessandro , no ! she had chosen her martyrdom over sin , god over satan . overcome with rage , alessandro plunged the knife into maria's breast fourteen times . finally he came to his senses and thought maria was dead . frantically he threw the knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room . the crying of the baby teresa on the landing brought the attention to assunta and the father of alessandro . as the baby was unattended and was in danger of falling off , they ran to the house to find maria , who , covered in blood , was dragging herself to the door . when asked what happened she said alessandro stabbed her . he wanted to make me do wrong and i would not . the ambulance arrived , then the police who took alessandro away . as the ambulance carried maria to the hospital , a large crowd followed on foot . the doctors at the hospital held no hope for poor little maria . the same fr . jerome who gave maria her first communion 5 came to administer the last rites and to give her holy viaticum . he asked maria if she would forgive her murderer . yes . for the love of jesus i forgive him . i wish for him to one day join me in paradise . may god forgive him , for i alread y have . maria died at about three o clock . alessandro was tried and found guilty of maria's death but because of his age he was sentenced to only thirty years in prison . after eight years of being a violent prisoner and show ing no regret for his crime , he saw in a dream , in the midst of a field of flowers , maria holding out a bunch of white lilies to him . soon later he wrote to the local bishop , begging god's par don for the grave sin he had committed . he later gave testimony in maria's beatification in 1947 . less than three years later , on ju ne 24th 1950 , maria was canonised . assunta goretti was the first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation . may st maria goretti help us to be pure and grant us the strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin . saint maria goretti , pray for us . by brendan arthur  internet viva cristo rey ! long live christ the king .
4			torture	russia			 five russian soldiers sentenced to death in azerbaijan  may 13 , 1993 five russian soldiers sentenced to death in azerbaijan  moscow upi five soldiers who served in russia's 7th army stationed in armenia were sentenced to death in the azerbaijani capital baku thursday for allegedly carrying out diversions and killing 30 azeri soldiers . a statement released by the news service of azeri president abulfaz elchibey said the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , the russian state news agency itar tass reported . but the russian foreign ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in moscow for punishment . this would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes , the statement reads . the five men , together with another soldier who received a 15 year prison sentence , were captured in september 1992 by azeri police in the kelbadzhar district of azerbaijan , between nagorno karabakh and armenia . the supreme court in baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the russian 7th army in the armenian capital yerevan , after which they were sent across the armenian azeri border into nagorno karabakh to carry out diversions against azeri troops . however , the russian foreign ministry statement claimed they had deserted the russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with armenian armed forces in the battle zone round karabakh . nagorno karabakh is an armenian populated enclave within azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes . both yerevan and baku have always claimed that russian servicemen stationed in these caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break up of the soviet union , are fighting as mercenaries in the karabakh war . the statement from moscow said the russian side repeatedly appealed to the azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men , and to hand them over to the russian authorities . it said that president boris yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his azeri counterpart elchibey . itar tass said that the soldiers defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency .    david davidian armenia has not learned a lesson in s . d . p . a . center for regional studies anatolia and has forgotten the po box 382761 punishment inflicted on it . 4 14 93 cambridge , ma 02238 late turkish president turgut ozal

5			interpretation	matthew	text	translation			 variants in the nt text cont . does anyone now where an english translation of the long recension of the acts of the apostles can be found ? 1 an english translation of this can be found in the acts of the apostles , translated from the codex bezae , with an introduction on its lucan origin and importance , j . m . wilson london , 1923 . 2 another work that might be useful is the acts of the apostles , a critical edition with introduction and notes on selected passages , albert c . clark oxford , 1933 ; reprinted 1970 . this is an edition of text of acts that makes the assumption that the text in codex bezae is the more authentic . i don not know if it actually contains an english translation or not . 3 another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is the theological tendency of the codex bezae cantabrigiensis in acts , eldon j epp cambridge , 1966 . 4 the most recent reference i found was an edition in french from the early 80s . i can supply the reference if anyone's interested . 5 now , many of the works are going to be difficult to find . so if you are interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent and easily obtainable discussion can be found in a textual commentary on the greek nt , bruce metzger united bible society , 1971 . metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the ubs 3rd edition of the greek nt . it contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the ubs3 . furthermore , notes on an addition 600 readings are included in atcotgnt the majority of these occur in acts . an attempt was made to set before the reader a more or less full report with an english translation of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by western witnesses . since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text volume , care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings . p 272 . i understand that one of the early codexes , vaticanus and siniaticus has this version of acts . it would be interesting to know what the differences are between the long and the short forms. 6 most of the copies of the text of acts that we have including the ones in vaticanus and siniaticus adher pretty closely to the shorter or alexandrian version . the longer version to which you refer is usually called the western version and its main witness is the codex bezae althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources . 7 as far as size , the difference is that in clark's edition mentioned above the book of acts contains 19 , 983 words whereas the text edited by westcott and hort a typical alexandrian text contains 18 , 401 words ; i.e. a difference of about 8 1 2 . 8 to answer the obvious questions , no , there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text . the main difference seems to expansion of detail in the western text or , if you prefer contractions in the alexandrian . the western text seems to be given to more detail . there are some interesting specific cases , but this probably not the place to go into it in detail . 9 the discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy . if there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is i that neither text represents purely the authentic version , ii each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however , iii the variant in the alexandrian text is the better more often than not . n

5			memory			 consciousness part ii kev strikes back !  this post is probably either brilliant or insane . do let me know which .  a brilliant example of using the introspective objection against materialist theories of consciousness . diplomatic i realize i m fighting occam's razor in this argument , so i will try to explain why i feel a mind is necessary . firstly , i m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. they are great at solving problems once the method has been worked out , but not at working out the method itself . as a specific example , i like to solve numerical crosswords not the simple do the sums and insert the answers type , the hard ones . to do these with any efficiency , you need to figure out a variety of tricks . now , i know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles , but in doing so you have to work out the tricks yourself , and program them into the computer . you can , of course , obfuscate the trick , and write the program so that it is uncovered , but as far as i can see , the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered . does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre programmed into our brains ? this is somewhat unlikely , given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material , much of which isn not used . one way around this is to bring the environment into the equation , but again , as far as i can see this still has an air of if you see object x , then perform action y , and we don not seem to get anywhere . the algorithm has to anticipate what it might see , and what conclusions to draw from it's experience . the other problem with algorithms is their instability . not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code , yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are side effects , but patients still seem remarkably stable . also , neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it's code ? the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour ? replace colour with the sensation of your choice . presumably , the materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of chemical reaction . the usual products of such a reaction are energy different chemicals . is colour a mixture of these ? if this is so , a computer won not see colour , because the chemistry is different . does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn not ? it shouldn not , because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances . so why do we see colour ?  however , such a view is actually a nonsolution . how should minds be able to act as observers , feel pain and pleasure and issue commands any better than the brain ? moreover , how do the interactions occur ? a bit of idle speculation . if i remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction , with two processes acting on it . the first process has been called unitary evolution or u , is governed by schroedinger's equation and is well known . the second process , called various things such as collapse of the wavefunction or 'state vector reduction or r , and is more mysterious . it is usually said to occur when a measurement takes place , although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs . when it does occur , the effect of r is to abruptly change the wavefunction . i envisage r as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something else , which i shall imaginitively call part x . it seems reasonable to assume that something causes r , although that something might be the wavefunction itself in which case , part x is simply the wavefunction . note , though , that we would need more than u to explain r . anyway , i m speculating that minds would be in part x . there seems to be some link between consciousness and r , in that we never see linear superpositions of anything , although there are alternative explainations for this . i have no idea how a brain is supposed to access part x , but since this is only speculation , that won not matter too much my main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics . i will go back to my nice padded cell now , if that's ok with you   petri   kevin anthoney don not believe anything you read in . sig files .

confusing . an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively . this definition does not include all atheists see the faq . however , i for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations . it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes , and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention , or anything spiritual , for that matter . humans are not omnipotent , and neither is science . however , science has one advantage theology doesn not it is self correcting , with nature as its judge . it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent , simple picture of our universe . science is no longer a bunch of separate branches , it is one . from particle physics to psychology . and no aspect of our life , or our universe , is safe from its stern and stony eye . not even our consciousness . there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything . there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics , chemistry , biology , etc . everything is random , nothing is determnined . actually , determinism vs . indeterminism is a philosophical question , and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not . i think the question does not have any meaning , as far as individual human beings go . if their apparent free will is an illusion , it does not appear to be so from their perspective . bill , can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not ? this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products . there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence , it's just a happy accident . maybe . who are we to tell ? it seems intelligence is useful when during the history of earth has one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere ? this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves . even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the systems that can start replicating will survive , those which don not don not make it . recommended reading t . o for an atheist , no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense , and no thought about an event can have value . from whose perspective ? i value events and things subjectively , from my perspective . nature does not have values , because it does not have a perspective values arise from awareness . if i have a subjective perspective , it is easy to assume that other people also do , and if i think about what it would it be like in their position , i will eventually discover the golden rule . morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens , in fact , it may be a product of evolution . perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful , allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity , too . bill , have you ever read aristotle ? try his ethica nikomakhea sp . for starters . how then can an atheist judge value ? what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god ? on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned ? it seems that , in judging the values that motivate others to action , you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured , but what in nature can serve that purpose ? what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values . c . s . lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian . the argument is severely flawed . some values , such as the golden rule , can have a rational basis . some others , like the basic idea of wanting to live , has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired . lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour , and morality as well . indeed , as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools , they also became better at killing each other . it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools , but not against one's own people . the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this . a simple set of rules to hold the people together , under one god . their god did not care much about people of other nations . at the time of the nt , things were quite different the jews were under rule of an empire , and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles . a new situation required a new morality , and along with it a new religion was born . a mutation in a meme pool . since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event , what difference could it possibly make what anyone does , religious or otherwise , there can be no meaning or gradation of value . the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn not like it that's it . any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense . it looks like you haven not bothered to read philosophy . whenever there is an observer , there is a subjective point of view , which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event , and other's happiness , too , if the observer comes to think about it . in an absolutely objective sense , that is , without any observers or subjects , moral judgments lose their meaning . it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view . this includes gods , too , their values are only their personal judgments , not absolute truths , since such truths do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence . morality is not property of humans alone chimps , dolphins and many other species show great care for each other . dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning , a good deed indeed . that you don not like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction . that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you have been conditioned ; there is no truth content . the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion , a virtual reality . the last statement does not logically follow . in fact , there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well , and our senses can convey reliable information . solipsism is still a logical possibility , but not a very likely one . you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view , which does not exist . any observer or thinker , any personal being , has its own point of view . it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not , it does not cease to be subjective . from a non observers non point of view , values do not exist neither does pain , or pleasure , or beauty , or love . such things are inherently subjective . once again , if god wants wives to submit to their husbands , or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown , or wants to punish us if we don not , i disagree with his morals . i do not think my morals come from any supreme being to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie , a machine without a single thought . if god gave us morality to judge , but i disagree with him , it is not my fault . he is free to replace my morals . i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and then to get mad at this . god must be schizophrenic . all of this being so , you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , etc. and cannot participate . your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever . neither can the opinion of any god , for that matter . i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else . bill , take note absolute values must be independent of any being , including gods . if god has a subjective viewpoint , it is his own point of view , and his morals are his own . petri  . petri pihko kem pmp mathematics is the truth . ! . pihatie 15 c finou . oulu . fi physics is the rule of . sf 90650 oulu kempmp the game . .

4			iraq			 israeli destruction of mosque s in jerusalem the cases aren not really comparable . a project like a freeway requires public hearings , court action , appeals , advance determination of restitution , and so on . the razing of the moghrabi district in east jerusalem happened within hours of the end of the hostilities of the 6 day war . the residents were given only two or three hours notice to pack up and find accomodations elsewhere . they had no chance of public hearing , debate , appeal , negotiation or anything . it was get out or die in the rubble . in today's jerusalem post magazine there is a feature story about the ongoing restoration of synagogues in the jewish quarter . the author , leah abramowitz , writes that there were fifty seven synagogues in the quarter in 1948 , all of which were destroyed , some , she says , used as donkey stables . the building shells , that is . i still find it really , really hard to understand why the demolition of the buildings in front of the kotel continues to evoke more outrage than this . everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the jews . why ?  bill coleman

2			basketball	detroit	hockey	playoff	vs	baseball	chicago	toronto			 blues into playoffs , beat tb 6 5 blues , shanahan , joseph , hull , minnesota , tb by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at 9 11 thursday night , the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer . their cheer quickly turned into a roar , and finally , the sellout crowd of 17 , 816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 oakland avenue in a salute to the playoff bound blues . the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit red wings 5 , stars 3 . with the north stars loss , the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division . good thing , because the blues quit playing . they held a 5 1 lead over tampa bay when the detroit minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period . they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6 5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer . tampa's bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers , but officiating supervisor john d amico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired . i m glad i didn not see it go in at the end , blues coach bob berry said . if the goal had counted , he would have been more upset than he was by the blues disappearance in the final 24 minutes . holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berry's anger . it wasn not pretty at the end , he said . we played 36 , 37 great minutes , as good as we played all year . it slipped away at the end . it shouldn not have , but it did . still , the blues won , prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end . despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season , the blues still made the playoffs . they will meet the chicago blackhawks in a best of seven norris division semifinal , beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium . the blues finished the regular season with a record of 37 36 11 for 85 points , their fourth consecutive plus . 500 season . minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place , with a record of 36 38 10 for 82 points . tampa bay , which played spoiler last week by tying the blues 2 2 at tampa , ended its first season with a record of 23 54 7 for 53 points . the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room . instead , the mood was one of relief and some disappointment . it's a shame we let down , said kevin miller , one of three blues to score two goals . brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others . there was no need for a letdown . if we would have kept working , it would have ended 6 2 and everyone would be happy . instead , a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs . we won , and that's all that matters , said brett hull , scoreless and minus 3 for the night . once we got up 4 0 , it was really tough to play . some players didn not have a problem . just because the score was announced , our line didn not quit , said rich sutter , who played with bassen and miller . we still had a game to play . you can not allow five goals like we did , that's not right . it was disappointing to see what was going on . bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort . somehow , he missed the announcement of minnesota's loss . i didn not know it was final , he said . i was kind of looking around on the bench . i didn not realize it was a final for some reason . we are in the playoffs , and that's great , but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end . the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesota detroit score off of the board the score showed 0 0 until it first popped up with detroit leading 4 2 in the third period . the blues already led 4 0 at the time . i told them i didn not want to see the score , i didn not want to know the score , berry said . i felt we had to win the game , and that's the approach we took . if minnesota took a lead , berry feared , the pressure of having to win might bother the blues . if detroit led , he worried , the blues might quit . until the announcement , the blues played splendidly . shanahan got the crowd going at 10 44 of the first period , scoring his 50th of the season . then , miller and bassen took charge late in the period . with the teams playing four on four , miller broke in on left wing , deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21 . 6 seconds remaining in the period . then , just 10 . 5 seconds later , bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone . bassen made it 4 0 just 14 seconds into the second period , scoring on the rebound of bret hedican's shot . the goal gave him his first two goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend . last year , bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill , who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on feb . 23 . i was thinking of my buddy oliver , bassen said . he's in heaven now , and i know he was watching . i know he's happy . miller increased the blues lead to 5 0 on a break away goal set up by zombo at 11 09 . then , steve maltais broke curtis joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later , making it 5 1 . less than a minute after the north stars final was announced , tim bergland scored and cut the lead to 5 2 . but shanahan scored his 51st , converting a pass from nelson emerson with 21 . 3 seconds remaining in the second period . then , it was all lightning . adam creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period , prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph . guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of 1 21 midway through the third period . the goals by chambers and cole made shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner . we were in there , shanahan said . the game was over . we were in .   a l l e z l e s b l u e s ! !   joe ashkar contact for the blues saint louis blues

3			computer	space			 level 5 ? given that i have heard the shuttle software rated as level 5 . level 5 ? out of how many ?  . also keep in mind that it was not achieved through the use of sophisticated tools , but rather through a brute force and ignorance attack on the problem during the challenger standdown they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand . i think this is a little inaccurate , based on feynman's account of the software development process before the standdown . fred is basically correct no sophisticated tools , just a lot of effort and painstaking care . but they got this one right before challenger ; feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people . he also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners , but hadn not had to give in to it much yet . among other things , the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre flight simulations , and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in flight failure . as a result , the number of major simulation failures could be counted on one hand , and the number of in flight failures was zero . as fred mentioned elsewhere , this applies only to the flight software . software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters , and gets nowhere near the same level of tender loving care . none of the experimenters could afford it .  all work is one man's work . henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling utzoo ! henry

5			jerusalem	jew	jesus	religion	christianity	judaism			 jewish history question  deleted here tis . someone just told me that the old testament books were translated into greek a long time ago yes , that's a famous version called the septuagint . it was a translation made by greek jews . and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward no. i don not know what you are referring to here . when the jersusalem temple was destroyed , some manuscripts may have been lost , but i think our extant hebrew manuscripts are as good as our greek ones . i don not know about any originals . the person who was telling me about the septuagint version said that the greeks had a wonderful library in alexandria that was full of manuscripts scrolls and that it was burned soon after the septuagint version was translated perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions , or perhaps just as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes in power groups , he i dunno . no. the library at alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the world . the greeks had a love of wisdom , philo sophos , and this great love was reflected in the alexandrian library . the christians got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the moslems invaded and either the christians burned the library to keep it from falling into moslems hands far more likely since they were the book burners , not the moslems , or it burned in the sack of the city or the moslems burned it . either way , a tremendous amount of information was lost the destruction of the library of alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man against man . so , i was just wondering , since i imagine some jewish people somewhere must have had copies of the earlier hebrew versions , is the hebrew version of the old testament very different from the greek derived version ? no. there are a few famous discrepancies isaiah's prophecy about a young woman was changed into a virgin , which was how the new testament writers read it , but not many . actually , the hebrew almah , young woman , was translated as the hellenistic greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the modern and technical english term virgin . the jews did not have the type of virginity cult that the greco romans had in artemis and diana . well , perhaps this is the answer then . deleted if you go to a jewish bookstore , you will get a bible translated by jews , so there will be some differences in interpretation , but the text they are translating from is basically the same . the standard text used by christians and jews is the masoretic text . jews of course use the text in its original hebrew , without translation . if you want to read the original , you can buy an interlinear bible . that contains the hebrew old testament and the greek new testament , with an english translation written underneath each word if you want a bible with a possibly more original basic text , you can try to find a samaritan bible . good luck ! i have never seen one . the samaritans no , not the good samaritans have their own version of the 5 books of moses . they claim the jewish bible was altered by ezra . propaganda . thanks for the tips . now i just have to find someone to teach me samaritan just me , little e so , is a good samaritan hard to find ? or is a hard . oh , finish this

5			jesus	religion	god			 the laws of god was re a kind and loving god !  these are two conflicting statements . to say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic . i don not mind people shifting their position on an issue . it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made . what about deuteronomy 22 20 25 ? is it wrong now ? did jesus change that ?  if anything , he clarified the law such as in that quote you made . in the following verses , jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended .  sure he does this . however , he doesn not address the notion of stoning non virgin brides , because this needs no clarification . are you going to deny that deuteronomy 22 20 25 is not patently clear in its intent ?  i see what you are getting at or at least i think i do . correct me if i am mistaken , but i think you are asking me if i still believe that we should uphold all of the laws pertaining to capital punishment for such things as adultery , rape and other heinous crimes . as you may recall , jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress who was caught in the act and brought before jesus . and his reply , let he who is without sin cast the first stone . jesus does not deny the sentence that is to due for this violation of the law . what do you think of this ?  i think you will agree with me that there are in today's world , a lot of modern day pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it . what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart ?  i will agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible from end to end and don not believe in it . depending on how they use this knowledge , they can be scary . they can argue any position they desire , and back it up with selected parts of the bible . such pharisees include david koresh and adolph hitler . i will qualify this by saying i don not know if they actually believed what they were preaching , but the ends certainly made the means look frightening .  agreed .  however , just as scary are those that don not know much of the bible , but believe every word in fact , this is probably scarier , since there are far more of these people , from what i have seen . in addition , they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees , since they don not know enough to debate with these people .  agreed also . if one is to use the bible as a reference , one must always be open to different interpretations . as a christian , i have the spirit of god to verify what i believe in the word if what the spirit tells me is not backed up in scripture then the spirit i am communicating with is not of god . after all , jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that it is from god .  christianity is not just a set of rules ; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct . and it demands obedience to god's will .  no , it demands obedience to a book . if god came down and personally told me how i should behave , then i would say that i would be doing god's will by doing it . however , if preachers , pastors , and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia even longer for the ot , even if i follow everything in it with my heart , i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying i m doing the will of god .  i obey what the spirit of god tells me to do . the spirit will not violate anything that is written in the bible because that is the word of god . i do not worship pastors , preachers , my wife , my mother or my father . what they tell me does not carry the weight of what god tells me to do and his commands are rienforced in the bible .  some people can live by it , but many others cannot or will not . that is their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too .  well , if god respects it so much , how come there is talk in the bible about eternal damnation for non believers ? i see little respect eminating from the god of the bible . i see a selfish and spiteful god .  eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting god . if you choose to jump off a cliff , you can hardly blame god for you going splat at the bottom . he knows that if you choose to jump , that you will die but he will not prevent you from making that choice . in fact , he sent his son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below . to prove that point , jesus took that plunge himself but he being god was able to rise up again . i have seen the example of christ and have chosen not to jump and i m trying to tell you not to jump or else you will go splat .  you don not have to listen to me and i won not stop you if you decide to jump . i only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge . you owe it to yourself . i don not like seeing anyone go splat . god be with you ,  malcolm lee

5			jesus	genesis	christ	trinity	god			 jacob and esau reincarnation gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives .  i wrote that the apostle paul , in romans 9 , speaks of god as choosing jacob over esau , and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done , since they had not been born yet .  clearly , paul does not believe that they had had previous lives , nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it . for if they had had previous lives , it would not make sense to say , neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet , since they are not yet born .  paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past , just as the fate of the man born blind john 9 was not . there is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny . even the eastern traditions , or many of them , do not say that , as one knowledgeable poster pointed out . and if in fact that paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it . even john the baptist , who jesus says emphatically is elijah matt 11 14 , does not appear to have been aware of it , at least at the point at which he was asked . but it is interesting that his threefold denial to the question whether he is the christ , the prophet i.e. isaiah , or elijah , is emphatic in the first case and very weak in the third i would like to add once again that , while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives , one way or another , what i really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of christianity and christian doctrine . for the most part , those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of christianity or , if they are christians , hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure . i believe that christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it , and vice versa , much that is central to christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives . it has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed in this newsgroup in particular . i have said openly that i have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of rudolf steiner . not that i hold him as an authority , but the whole picture of christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas . steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times , after a time of development of the christ idea through the first two millenia after christ's deed on golgotha . in our own time , it becomes important that , having received the basic gospel of salvation , our understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the significance of this idea . for the discussions in this newsgroup , i have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible to scripture and to fundamental christian teaching and tradition . gerry palo
2			fear	animal	dog			 boom ! dog attack ! my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something . i have weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target , then take off and laugh at the dog , now far behind you . this time , it didn not work because i didn not have time . riding up the hill leading to my house , i encountered a liver and white springer spaniel no relation to the springer softail , or the springer spagthorpe , a close relation to the spagthorpe viking . actually , the dog encountered me with intent to harm . but i digress i was riding near the unpainted centerline of the roughly 30 foot wide road , doing between forty and sixty clicks 30 mph for the velocity impaired . the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed . i later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch , about thirty feet away , heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road . i saw the dog , and before you could say sipde , he was on me . boom ! i took the dog in the left leg , and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force , making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike , and cracking one panel . i think i saw the dog spin around when i looked back , but my memory of this moment is hazy . i next turned around , and picked the most likely looking house . the apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt cut mouth and hoped i was not hurt either . i could feel the pain in my shin , and expected a cool purple welt to form soon . sadly , it has not . so i m left with a tender shin , and no cool battle scars ! interestingly , the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course . the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course , nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact . delayed pain may have helped me here , as i didn not feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember . what worries me about the accident is this i don not think i could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was . this is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area , but i was riding around the speed limit . i worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog , but i console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15 30 mph . for that matter , how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end ? i eagerly await comment . ryan cousinetc. 1982 yamaha vision xz550 black pig of inverness live to ride kotrb 1958 ajs 500 c s king rat to work to dod 0863 i would be a squid if i could afford the bike . flame to vancouver , bc , canada live . slmr 2 . 1a he's hurt . dammit jim , i m a doctor oh , right .    computer dynamics bbs 604 255 9937 hst 604 986 9937 v32 vancouver , bc , canada easy access , low rates , friendly sysop

2			car	automobile	mechanic	safety	accident	speed			 is car saftey important ? much discussion about economics of safety deleted safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car . i won not buy a small car like a civic or whatever .  great safety handling speed for me  seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car after an accident . this is a very simplistic view of safety . assuming that you are in a collision less likely with a more agile smaller car , then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you . this is why a thousand pound f1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a suburban hits a wall at 35 as i recall for the last generation suburban hic numbers . as an aside , just what is the point of an airbag ? it seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners audi et al , or a good tight 5 point belt will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag . you might be saved from some flyign glass ? or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt ? craig  gerrit

2			player	hockey	people	sport			 flyers re this year's biggest and worst opinion . nhl , awards so in other words , if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins , that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision ? come on , joe , think about what you are saying ! who they played is very significant . why they played them is what's irrelevent . a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders . a low gaa is better then a higher gaa . a low gaa against good teams is much , much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders . let's start over . i m not arguing about who is the better goaltender . i would take soderstrom right now . what i am saying is that roussel can be a 1 netminder . the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night , their save percentages are close , and their records are similar . and with that , i just don not see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season . you say soderstrom played against better competition . that may very well be , but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games . besides , against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh , the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose . the same for roussel in the ranger game . two real scoring chances , one he made a great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player . if you were judging roussel on that game alone , you have very little to go by . but i m not just judging roussel on that game alone . i have seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey . it's just my opinion , but i think he's got what it takes . of course , i thought that about mark laforest , too . but i never did about wendell young . so i m batting . 500 in judging hershey talent since the hextall era . as for the rangers game , you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like . but rou had his leg in position to make the save . if he didn not , it wouldn not have mattered if the rangers player didn not get the puck up or not . it would have been a goal . on a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do , take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him . but if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the habs , you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout . that was a 1 goalie in action . roussel doesn not have a game like that in him . i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending champs . and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs . but you can not tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it . mistakes , both on offense and defense are part of the game . or there would never be shutouts . anyway , i m happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and i m not going to argue about it anymore . besides , with the current 7 game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year , i don not want to piss you off to the point that you don not sell me any tickets next season .  joe dakes at&t microelectronics 555 union boulevard allentown , pa 18103 let's go flyers ! alux1 ! jmd

5			peace	terrorist	america	democracy	war	iraq			 gulf war and peace niks . actually , i rather like your idea . perhaps the rest of the world should have bombed or maybe missiled washington when the us invaded nicaragua , grenada , panama , vietnam , mexico , hawaii , or any number of other places .  wait a minute , doug . i know you are better informed than that . the us has never invaded nicaragua as far as i know . we liberated grenada . liberate is the way an invader describes an invasion , including , if i m not mistaken , the iraqi liberation of kuwait . never invaded nicaragua ? only with more word games can you say send in the marines ? so if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where we cross someone's border , you are right 5 out of 6 . but normally invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation . if some nation invades the u.s. virgin islands , would they be invading the virgin islands or the u.s . so from this point of view , your score falls to 2 out of 6 mexico , panama . oh , good word games . if you let the aggressor pick the words , there's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action . what's a peace nik ? is that somebody who doesn not masturbate over guns n ammo or what ? is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik ?  no , it's someone who believes in peace at all costs . in other words , a person who would have supported giving hitler not only austria and czechoslakia , but poland too if it could have averted the war . and one who would allow hitler to wipe all all jews , slavs , and political dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone . that's a convenient technique , much seen on alt . atheism define those who disagree with you according to a straw man extreme that matches virtually nobody . is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik , you ask ? well , it depends on what your values are . if you value life over liberty , peace over freedom , then i guess not . but if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself ; if you would rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant's heel , then yes , it's bad to be a peace nik . very noble and patriotic . i m sure the fine young americans who carpet bombed iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon , destroyed iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the sky or further , or who bulldozed other iraqi infantry into their trenches or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to were just thrilled to be risking death if not risking it by much in the defense of the liberty of . well , wealthy kuwaitis . can not have those oil fields under a tyrant's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic to us interests . the problem with most peace niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be bad and unconscionable . i would not have any argument or problem with a peace nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues , especially those dealing with the national defense . but no , they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point of view . having pigeon holed peace niks in this context , people who disagree with me about the conduct of the gulf war into peace at all cost hitler supporting genocide abetting wimps , you can now express righteous indignation when they refuse to fit this mold and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms. how dare they ! they militate and many times resort to violence all in the name of peace . what rank hypocrisy ! yes , hypocrisy indeed ! those violent peace niks ! care to list an example here ? all to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up and defend our freedoms against tyrants , and who realize that to do so requires a strong national defense . wow instant 80's nostalgia ! of course , peace nik itself is a 50's cold war derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism with godless pinko communists . yes indeed , i felt my freedoms mightily threatened by iraq .  jim perry decision support , incorporation , matthews nc these are my opinions . for a nominal fee , they can be yours .

2			motorcycle	car	america	automobile			 did us drive on the left ? 1ppqkm $  the reason i ask is because i went to a classic car meet here in the uk , and saw a very nice old de soto , 1920's vintage i would guess , with wooden artillery type wheels , etc , but it was right hand drive . i can not believe that desoto produced rhd cars just for the uk . well sweden and australia , and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the wrong side of the road , so the export market might have been larger then than just the uk . i m guessing , but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts . i am fairly sure that placement of the steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time . by the 1920s , there was a very active good roads movement , which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze , picked up steam in the teens witness the linclon highway association , 1912 or so , and the us highway support act real name something different in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads . also , the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during ww 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense . anyway , by the 20s there were plenty of good roads , at least around urban areas , and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside . this was the era , after all , of the first auto touring fad , the motel , the auto camp ground , etc. two good books on the subject spring to mind warren belasco america on the road title may not be exact author is and another called the devil wagon in god's country author i forget . also , any of john flink's or john bell rae's auto histories . as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary , by the early teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel on the left . in the early days , cars had the wheel on the left , on the right , and even in the middle , as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel . this was standardized fairly early on , though i don not know why . dan carnegie mellon university applied history world history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe , whether we can comprehend and prove it or not . oswald spengler

3			key	encryption			 re inventing crypto policy ? an eff statement i somehow started to doubt technical competence of the people who designed the system . why on the earth split the 80 bit key in 40 bit parts to keep them in escrow separately having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply could keep 80 bit sequences in n n 2 independent places and then xor all the partial keys to get the actual key n 1 sequences should obviously be selected randomly and nth is the actual key xor ed with the random sequences . without real technical details , it's hard to answer this question . but suppose they already are xoring the two 40 bit parts to produce only 40 bits of real key material ? maybe they are using the exportable version of rc2 . phil
2			manager	bond	strikeout	baseball	pitcher	twin	hitting	pitching			 why is barry bonds not batting 4th ? i like the clark williams bonds order . pitchers can only walk clark with 2 outs unlike last year . williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the on deck circle . since matt has a terrible batting eye , this helps the giants a lot . when bonds gets on base all by himself , he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by thompson , manwaring , or clayton . if you bat bonds before the other sluggers , then you don not want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big inning . also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double . the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the bases infront of bonds . and i think that's a problem the giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot . ken kubey 415 390 3536

3			hacking	encryption			 once tapped , your code is no good any more . the date i have for this is 1 26 93 note clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph . i guess this statement doesen not contradict what you said , though . cut here washington upi the war on drugs is about to get a fresh start , president clinton told delegates to the national federation of police commisioners convention in washington . in the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural , clinton said that his planned escalation of the drug war would make everything so far seem so half hearted that for all practical purposes this war is only beginning now . he repeatedly emphasized his view that regardless of what has been tried , or who has tried it , or how long they have been trying it , this is day one to me . the audience at the convention , whose theme is how do we spell fiscal relief ? f o r f e i t u r e , interrupted clinton frequently with applause . clinton's program , presented in the speech , follows the outline given in his campaign position papers a cabinet level drug czar and boot camps for first time youthful offenders . he did , however , cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement methods . this year's crime bill will have teeth , not bare gums , clinton said . in particular , his administration will place strict controls on data formats and protocols , and require the registration of so called cryptographic keys , in the hope of denying drug dealers the ability to communicate in secret . clinton said the approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground economic activity , such as the deficit causing tax evaders who live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren . clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won because even though not everyone voted for bill clinton last november , everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of urgency about fighting the drug menace . the advocates of legalization the advocates of surrender may be very good at making noise , clinton said . but when the american people cast their ballots , it only proved what i knew all along that the advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe . just doing a quick reality check here is this for real or did someone invent it to provoke a reaction from people ? it sounds more like the sort of thing you would have heard , suitably rephrased , from the leader of a certain german political party in the 1930's . peter .

2			science	brake	math	speed			 countersteering , to know or not to know what is the question ? there has been a running thread on the need to understand countersteering . i have seen a lot of opinion , but not much of it has any basis in fact or study . the bottom line is the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among the accident involved riders in the hurt study . the average rider does not identify that countersteering alone provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves , even after many years of practice . i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs . but did the hurt study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure to swerve ? in most of the accidents and near accidents that i have seen , riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare , simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over rides everything else . hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive manouvres did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable ?
5			jesus	religion	christianity	theology	christ	catholicism	christian	conversion	god			 definition of christianity ? i have enrolled in the history of christianity at a college here in st louis . the teacher of the class is what i consider to be closed minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of christianity is . his definition is tied directly to that of the trinity and the catholic church's definition of it and belief in jesus christ is not sufficient to call one's self a christian . while his saying it doesn not make it so , i nevertheless feel insulted or am i just neurotic ? i would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student teacher relationship . so , is there common definition of what christianity is ? as the previous discussion of the trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames , i am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames . regards ,  larry autry silicon graphics , st louis  often we get into discussions about who is christian . unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions . starting from the broadest , commonly used definitions are a historical definition people who accept christ as lord and savior a broad doctrinal definition narrow doctrinal definitions 1 by a historical definition i mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use . this would include any group that developed out of the christian church , and continues within the same broad culture . e.g. some unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with . yet it's clear that that group developed from christianity , and people from very different backgrounds e.g. hindus would likely see them as part of christianity . this is not a definition most christians like , but it's relevant in some political and ethnic contexts . 2 accepting christ as lord and savior is a test used by many christian groups for membership , e.g. the southern baptists and presbyterian church usa . i would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to christ , so that someone who accepted christ as one of many gods would not fit . it's an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine . by this definition , groups such as arians would be viewed as heretical christians , but still christians . in the modern context this would include mormons , jw's , and oneness pentecostals . they would be viewed as heretical christians , but still christian . in practice i believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the apostle's creed . 3 the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition , which includes all of the major strands of christianity , but excludes groups that are felt to be outside historic christianity . this is of course a slippery enterprise , since catholics could argue that protestants are outside historic christianity , etc. but i think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon . the attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of christianity agree are key . obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement . a mormon will regard the lds church as a major strand , and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs . but i think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance . 4 finally , some people use definitions that i would say are limited to a specific christian tradition . e.g. some evangelicals only consider someone christian if he has had an evangelical style conversion experience , and some i have even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church . i think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used . a lot is going to depend upon the purpose you are using it for . if you are using it descriptively , e.g. in history or anthropology , you will probably use definition 1 or 2 . if you are using it normatively , i.e. to say what you believe the christian message is , you will probably use a definition like 3 or even 4 . clh

5			woman	witchcraft	jesus	beauty	religion	sex	angel	god			 was jesus black ? this subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory . those who subscribe to biblical archaeology review will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a franklin mint ad . bar is a great magazine , but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme . in this ad , they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of nefertiti , giving the face a typical doll pink complexion . the letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that nefertiti was a beautiful black queen . this set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues , to the point where they had an article from an egyptologist titled was cleopatra black ? the answer to the title is no she was greek . i have to say that i hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining . i personally have seen only one blond haired jesus in the national shrine in wash . dc , and i found it very jarring . western representations vary enourmously , but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard , of a sort that can be found modulo the nose all up and down the mediterranean . also , if what i remember is correct , the black madonna doesn not represent a person with negroid features . it is black because of an accident . joe buehler . in the presence of all those marble statues , one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair . when one crosses the bosporus , the situation breaks down completely . are turks white ? how about persians , or various groups in the indian subcontinent ? was gandhi white ? how about the arabs ? or picture nassar and sadat standing side by side . and then there are the ethiopians . those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that any of these people are white i.e . of the racist's race . if i may risk a potentially inflammatory remark , one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race . considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other , i don not think that this jesus was white thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did . representations of jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine . it seems awfully self serving to insist that jesus belongs to one's own racial group .  c . wingate the peace of god , it is no peace , but strife closed in the sod . yet , brothers , pray for but one thing tove ! mangoe the marv lous peace of god .

thus it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped archer as a reference .  i was wrong . i admit that i do not have a handle on greek grammar , and thus confused kleros , the second to last word in acts 1 17 as being the plot of land discussed . in actuality it is chorion , which is the last word acts 1 18 . unfortunately my greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so i cannot report as to the nuances of the word  i don not know if someone else would have caught this , though i am sure that someone would be able to do so , but i have an aversion to disseminating mistakes , especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point    my reply . vary noble of you dave . i didn not want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong . although i am researching chorion a little .  db . of course the only other reference mr decenso has given is bullinger . and bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when i accused mr decenso of actually believing bullinger , he replied that i misquoted him  and you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing ? oh dear .  my reply . your misquotes of me are astounding , dave . read the beginning of this part of my response to see what i really said in my posting of this article .  actually mr decenso , you said that there was benefit to our argument , in that it caused to to rediscover bullinger's exegisis . i did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial , unless you were convinced by it .  my reply . thank you for correcting your restating of my points .  db . and mr decenso also replied  dave , these are not necessarily my views ; they are bullinger's . we will discuss the land issue in later posts , i m sure . i m only responding to this one you have directed re bullinger's views because it's enjoyable .  thus i apologize for thinking that even mr decenso could find such drek convincing . he should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of this is what bullinger believed , not necessarily what i believe . so which is it mr decenso ? do you find the exegisis convincing or not ?  my reply . one of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various bible scholars and students alike . when i present my views , i will clearly distinguish them from now on .  db . of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presented no greek exegisis at all , and mr decenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual greek . thus we find this demand on his part for quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement .  my reply . good point . but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory , you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations . nor have you dug deeper . i m glad you have begun in this post i will begin greek studies on these passages in more depth than i thought necessary , as well .  db . it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used as evidence . now we know what he claims for a standard , as he has stated it often enough  a the text itself b parallel passages c other pertinent scriptures d historical context e historical content f other pertinent historical info g cultural context h cultural content i other pertinent cultural info j grammatical construction k hebrew and greek word studies l etc.  but are these actual standards he has used , or simply empty hyperbole . let's see , he has used a , and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages , we see that he has also used b . on the other hand he has presented no use of  d historical context or e historical content or f other pertinent historical info or g cultural context or h cultural content or i other pertinent cultural info or j grammatical construction or even k hebrew and greek word studies remember , archer and bullinger don not count  thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings .  my reply . question do you find such criteria important ? if so , do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability , or will you continue to present shallow observations i don not mean this in a bad way . at this point in our debates , i have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages , since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses . i do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re judas in acts and matthew , but i will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria , since you desire me to . i hope you will also . it will greatly enhance our study of these passages .  db . the only thing he has actually used , beyond the passage itself , is any other passage . thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be  a the text itself b parallel passages  my reply . the reason is simple . you are mistating the passages . you claim that the passages contradict one another ; i do not see the passages contradicting one another . 1 they may very well be complimentary , as many scholarly sources mention ; 2 matthew may not be presenting judas death , as you claim . but we will look at your defense of this later .  also , the reward of iniquity in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces of silver in matthew's passages . although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is .  at this beginning stages in our debates , we are laying some scriptural groundwork , which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis .  db . of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with judas death , is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct .  my reply . one of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary . however , i see no problem in tony rose's explanation of judas death .    how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging himself in matthew 27 5 and falling headlong he burst open   this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels . many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious , irreconcilable error . some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts . however , this is not the case at all . matthew relates that judas hanged himself , while peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact . the two statements are indeed different , but do they necessarily contradict each other ? matthew does not say that judas did not fall ; neither does peter say that judas did not hang himself . this is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white . both accounts can be true and supplementary . a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom . after he hung there for some time , the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge , mangling his body in the process . the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation . this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined . from the bottom of the valley , you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular . there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . therefore , it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open . it is important to remember that we are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall . louis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself . this individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head . he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time . on the other hand , a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself , while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building . in this case , both are true , as both are true in the case of matthew's and peter's accounts of the death of judas . it is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event .    your only reason for rejecting this is , i believe , your attempt to discredit inerrancy . you haven not related how this is impossible or highly unlikely . here's what you said in an earlier post .   db quoting tony rose . there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . therefore , it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open . it is important to remember that we  are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced  was the decomposition of his body before his fall .  the added text in this version is so heavy that , assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics , you should find it not credible . but you seem to find tony rose's eisegesis satisfactory , while clearly rejecting david joslin's .    here , you discredit tony's explanation based on what you deem too heavy for the passages . but you haven not addressed why you feel that way . you can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction , but that doesn not tell me it didn not happen , nor have you shown why you reject that possibility .  questions is matthew lying or is luke lying ? or are they both lying ? or are either or both of them misinformed ? why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction ? i do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect .  db . at present though , mr decenso only asks two questions of me  1 you claim acts and matthew contradict one another in representing judas death . i ask you again to provide evidence that matthew stated judas died in the hanging . 2 you claim that the 30 pieces of silver in matthew that judas threw down in the temple and the chief priests used , is the reward of iniquity in acts that pictures judas in some way purchasing a field with ; therefore there is a contradiction . prove that the 30 pieces of silver and the reward of iniquity are one and the same .  actually i find question 1 to be a rather stupid request , but i will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points . first i would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life . in fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging except in fantasy cowboy movies , and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging .  my reply . i work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect . today , i got a call re a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack . he failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital . hanging attempts are not always successful .  to assume that because most hangings are successful , this one was also is begging the question , if i may quote you .  last night , listening to the bible answer man broadcast , the christian research institute's show , one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use . i am not all that familiar with them . the man on the bam show teaches comparative religion and logic . it was interesting  db . this is so prevalent that , so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself .  my reply . qualifiers are important at times , as we will see in an ot passage i will mention below . does hanging always have this outcome ? did matthew , who is the only source we have re judas hanging himself , state that judas died as a result ? to say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as . a boy age 14 hung himself . but he lived . this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover .  db . now i am not alone in this thought ; in fact , since mr decenso so respects christian scholarly including greek scholars opinion , i did some research .  my reply . thank you , dave .  db . interestingly , not one of the christian references i read , interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide .  my reply . above , mine so it's ok to use christian sources to back your points ? what about tony's position . do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility ?  also , is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong , or lying , or deceived in other parts of their books ? if so , should we do , as we have done with archer , toss them to the side and not value anything they say , including their interpretation of the hanging of judas ? i am sure you would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources .  you also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died . although that is very possibly true , do you find that in the text itself ? remember , that's the first criteria we must examine .  db . this included  the biblical knowledge commentary by woodward and zuck  my reply . which i own . it's a good source of commentary info . but not inerrant .  db . the interpreters on volume commentary on the bible by laydon the one volume bible commentary by j r dunelow word meanings of the testament ralph earl the abingdon bible commentary published by abingdon harpers bible commentary by william neal actually i could have presented many more as well  my reply . i appreciate your doing this research , dave . maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions more in depth study .  db . in each case , these references specifically describe that the interpretation of matt 27 5 as successful , suicide and thus i can only conclude that the  greek word apagchw ie hang oneself is translated as a successful hanging .  my reply . above , mine no you can not only conclude this , although , as tony says , this was a highly probable outcome . but matthew does not state death as being a result .  the greek word is apagcho . matthew 27 5 is it's only occurrence in the new testament .  in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus , it's only used in 2 samuel 17 23 now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed , he saddled a donkey , and arose and went home to his house , to his city . then he put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died ; and he was buried in his father's tomb .  notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself gr . sept . apagcho , but it explicitly adds , and died . here we have no doubt of the result . in matthew , we are not explicitly told judas died .  also , there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure . it simply means hang oneself .  db . but mr decenso , you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable  christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful .  my reply . above , mine reputable ? you mean ones that have never erred ? as far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful , that can not be done , even by me .  as i said in an earlier post .   although i still agree with tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding judas death taking into account several criteria , i have recently noticed some new things in matthew .  mat 27 5 8 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself . but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , it is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood . and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field , to bury strangers in . therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day .  first of all , notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of hanging . all it says is that he went and hanged himself . luke however , in acts , tells us that and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out . this is a pretty clear indication along with the other details given in acts peter's speech , the need to pick a new apostle , etc. that at least after judas fall , he was dead . so the whole concept that  matthew and luke both recount judas death is highly probable , but not clear  cut .    i also wrote .   my reply .  here we have a stickler , dave , that i have to say i just recently noticed . let's look at the passage in matthew  mat 27 4 saying , i have sinned by betraying innocent blood . and they said , what is that to us ? you see to it !  mat 27 5 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself .  mat 27 6 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , it is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood .  mat 27 7 and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field , to bury strangers in .  mat 27 8 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day .  notice verse 5 . then he . went and hanged himself . matthew does not say judas died , does it ? should we assume he died as a result of the hanging ?  what does acts say ? act 1 18 now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out .  act 1 20 for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling place be desolate , and let no one live in it ; and , let another take his office .  here we may have a graphic explanation of judas death . so , my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re the two accounts of judas death is this . matthew doesn not necessarily explain how judas died ; he does  say judas hanged himself , but he didn not specifically say judas died in the hanging incident .  however , acts seems to show us his graphic demise . therefore , there is no contradiction between matthew and acts re judas death .  .  my reply . . we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records his death . although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks , thereby bursting open , i can no longer assume that to be the case . therefore , no contradiction . matthew did not say judas died as a  result of the hanging , did he ? most scholars believe he probably did , but .    i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars explanations , but in looking at the texts initially , we can not assume judas died . it is , however , highly probable .  db . by the way , while all agree that judas died from the hanging , the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing . one simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthew's version as the correct version in both matt and acts . the biblical knowledge commentary suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted , his belly exploded which doesn not explain his headlong fall , or that his branch or rope broke , and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out which doesn not explain how a hanging man , would fall headlong rather than feet first .  my reply . the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors . how high the person was suspended before the fall , any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall , how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon , thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks , etc. in a superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage , we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics , but tony in the above quoted post gave us some .   a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom . after he hung there for some time , the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge , mangling his body in the process . the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation . this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined . from the bottom of the valley , you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular . there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . therefore , it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open .   db . now truthfully , i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing the source of the potter's field prophesy , but on the other hand the author is correct matthew does make that confusion . of course a biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god , will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas ie where the prophesy of the potter's field came from .  my reply . please , when we are done with this study on his death , remind me to discuss this with you .  db . as to your second question mr decenso , you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchased the land , was indeed for the betrayal , rather than some other source . i would point out that in acts , where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity acts 1 18 , it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about ie acts 1 16 . concerning judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus . now i would point out that when the bible describes an act of iniquity , and then immediately discusses the reward of iniquity , it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed .  my reply . dave , we are getting somewhere , aren not we !  act 1 15 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty , and said , act 1 16 men and brethren , this scripture had to be fulfilled , which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas , who became a guide to those who arrested jesus ; act 1 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry . act 1 18 now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out . act 1 19 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem ; so that field is called in their own language , akel dama , that is , field of blood . act 1 20 for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling place be desolate , and let no one live in it ; and , let another take his office .  notice that in verse 16 , the word iniquity is not used . rather , it states that judas became a guide to those who arrested jesus . but the writer did not stop there . vs . 17 , for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry . what part did judas play in their ministry ?  joh 12 6 this he said , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the money box ; and he used to take what was put in it . joh 13 29 for some thought , because judas had the money box , that jesus had said to him , buy those things we need for the feast , or that he should give something to the poor .  so , now we know what part judas played he was a treasurer , per se . right after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry treasurer , according to john , then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages of iniquity money that should have been put into the ministry , but was stolen by judas to purchase a field . i believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the wages of iniquity are . what do you think , dave ?  db . now since i have given you clear answers and even references , perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are instead of asking me what type i think you are , as you did to mr joslin .  my reply . i will gladly admit that i am a complete inerrantist , although i do not have that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view . frank  if one wished to contend with him , he could not answer him one time out of a thousand . job 9 3

5			jesus	religion	theology	christ	time	atheist	god			 atheist's views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart .   another answer is that god is the source of all existence . this sounds much better , but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist , then ? if god is the source of his own existence , it can only mean that he has , in terms of human time , always existed . but this is not the same as the source of all existence . this argument sounds like god does not exist , but meta exists , and from his meta existent perspective , he created existence . i think this is actually a nonsolution , a mere twist of words . always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings is not problematic . but , as you put , being the source of all existence , including one's own , would mean that god came from nothing , a concept alien to christianity and theism . it is better to understand the classical concepts of necessary and contingent existence . god exists necessarily , always . god created contingent beings . this is a coherent solution to existence , so long as the concept of god is coherent .  the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions . being an atheist myself , i do not accept such answers , since i do not have any other methods . not a very good answer . if reason cannot by any means understand something then it is likely that it is a null concept , something not in reality . ted kalivoda

4			russia			 armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes henrik my response to the shooting down of a turkish airplane over the henrik armenian air space was because of the ignorant posting of the henrik person from your country . turks and azeris consistantly want to henrik drag armenia into the karabakh conflict with azerbaijan . the henrik karabakhi armenians who have lived in their homeland for 3000 henrik years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are henrik the ones directly involved in the conflict . they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression . agression that has no mercy henrik for inocent people that are costantly shelled with mig 23's and henrik othe russian aircraft . henrik at last , i hope that the u.s. insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will henrik never occur again . da armenia is involved in fighting with azarbaijan . it is armenian da soldiers from mainland armenia that are shelling towns in azarbaijan . well , this is your opinion ! turkish azeris can bark all they want since the above is untrue . however , i am sure you guys would have never brought up armenia's involvement if karabakhi armenians had had heavy losses . da you might wish to read more about whether or not it is azeri aggression da only in that region . it seems to me that the armenians are better da organized , have more success militarily and shell azeri towns da repeatedly . read what ? the new york times , that is publishing anti armenian articles . nop , i have my resources . look , everyone knows how aggressive turks azeris have been in the past armenians are not gona sit around and watch fire works by azeris taught by turks . da it seems to me that the armenians are better organized , have more success da militarily and shell azeri towns repeatedly . buch of non sence crap and you know it . who the hell you think you are talking to ? azeris are fighting local armenians in nagarno karabakh . you tell me who has more mig's ? freedom fighters in nagarno karabakh or azerbaijan ? again , i will say it for the last time , armenia is not involved in this war and you guys want to bring this up in order to cover up the turkish involvment in the karabakh . go ahead , repeat as much as you want . da i don not wish to get into the cyprus discussion . turkey had the right to da intervene , and it did . perhaps the intervention was not supposed to da last for so long , but the constant refusal of the greek governments both da on the island and in greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed da for the ongoing standoff in the region . not a chance ! you can not convince me based on your reasons that your government did the right thing to invade cyprus . da lastly , why is there not a soc . culture . armenia ? i vote yes for it . da after all , it is now free . well , i am not in the position to agree or disadree with you .

3			diabetes	science	health	cancer	nutrition	biology			 vitamin a and infection i have sent gordon r . my posts on protein , vitamin c and vitamin a prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy . somehow i have managed to delete my vitamin a post from my text file . gordon r . had promised to send it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so i will just retype it . since digging through all my references is very time consuming took me all day for that pms post , i m not going to cite any references gordon r . has them . i m going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan's new nutrition textbook which was not in my original material to point out that what i m going to say has some support in the medical community . diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very , very long time . protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i have already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection . now i m going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u.s. as far as infection is concerned vitamin a . when vitamin a was originally discovered , it was commonly referred to as the anti infection vitamin . many people linus pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i have already covered . big mistake in my opinion . vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason . the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well . it's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite . vitamin a comes in two completely different forms retinol and beta carotene . retinol is the animal form and it's toxic , beta carotene is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic . both retinol and beta carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present 60 80 . the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein rbp . a normal human adult liver should have 500 , 000iu to 1 , 000 , 000iu of retinol stored . we are born with 10 , 000iu in our liver . u.s. autopsy has shown that about 30 of americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as they were born with . if you don not believe that nutritional reserves like that of retinol in the liver are important , then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you . but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserves are important , then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u.s. the u.s. rda for vitamin a in an adult male is 1 , 000 re or 5 , 000iu of vitamin a . for adult feamles its 800 re or 4 , 000iu of vitamin a . diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta carotene from their diet . but the nrc national research council was going to release a new rda table in 1985 that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised c to 90mg per day and a to 7 , 500iu per day for adult males . that report and it's recommendations was killed . why ? concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason . rdas are set to prevent clinical disease , not to keep nutrient reserves full . many scientist in the u.s. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept , especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress . the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the 1940's get enough to prevent clinical pathology , but not enough to fill the reserves . we know from autopsy that only about 10 of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve 500 , 000iu to 1 , 000 , 000iu . i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients . but for vitamin a , only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has stored . we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol level levels above 450ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and it's time to stop taking retinol . the normal range of serum retinol will be 20 100ug dl . hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2 , 000ug dl or higher interpretation of diagnostic test , wallach , m . d . a little brown series book . this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity . weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach , as you will see later in this post between 450ug dl and 2 , 000ug dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache , redness of the skin , hair loss , joint pain . i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full . you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it's time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pms studies . beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol . but taking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up i have seen estimates of 20 30 years if you are in the 30 that only has as much as you were born with in your liver 10 , 000iu . one other problem with beta carotene , if you have a zinc deficit , you will not convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zincorporation in addition , the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a . now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection ? the body uses vitamin a retinol for many different things . vision the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a . reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal . infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid . how do you convert retinol which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid ? you use enzymes , one of which requires vitamin c this is why pauling has tried to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a . vitamin c does play a role in infection interferon production for example but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid . if you increase your intake of vitamin c , you will increase your formation of retinoic acid . but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and once it's formed , it's used and then lost to the body . this is why the 1985 nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda's . most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves . if they don not have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a , they actually do themselves more harm than good . retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation . in the mucus membrane , it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system . the mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection . for cancer , retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide . cancer has two distinct steps , dna alteration and cell promotion . for cells that normally divide all the time , promoters are not that important . but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide , promoters are real important in the malignant process . this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and or beta carotene . chronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate . i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin a along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection . i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa , when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou's branch campus and when i give cme lectures . dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50 , 000iu of retinol . the serum level of retinol can also be used , but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10 , 000 to 20 , 000iu . asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruled out . in one study done on u.s. spanish americans where serum retinol levels were measured , 25 of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug dl . as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the u.s. that have had a history of high infection rates , we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels . what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a ? here are excerpts from their book vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol , it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue , and is required for reproduction , embryonic development , and bone growth . protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption , transport , and metabolism of vitamin a . retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid , which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision . the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum . the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is 20 to 90ug dl . lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores . serum levels greater than 100ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a . dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children . rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state . the bronchorespiratory tract , skin , genitourinary system , gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected . a daily intake of more than 7 . 5mg about 37 , 000iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg 100 , 000iu can result in a dry and itching skin , desquamation , erythematous dermatitis , hair loss , joint pain , chapped lips , hyperostois bony depositis , headaches , anorexia , edema and fatigue . they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults . their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative . i recommend that my students try 25 , 000iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection . they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab can not run it , i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest , give them the zinc along with the vitamin a . at 25 , 000iu per day , toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol . both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a . recall that the pms papers were using 100 , 000iu to 200 , 000iu of vitamin a . i don not suggest that my students use these high doses . if you wanted to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level , then you would be okay . but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that 25 , 000iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin c status are good without having to worry about toxicity . if they want to get more agressive , fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol . but vitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus . the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18 , 000iu of retinol per day . beta carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus . could just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help ? yes but the effect will take a long time to develop . my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it full . vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors . but when we have the m . d . 's in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress , i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation . marty b .
5			religion	islam	allah	controversy	jihad	muslim			 the inimitable rushdie re an anecdote about islam  stuff deleted what we should be demanding , is for khomeini and his ilk to publicly come clean and to show their proof that islamic law punishes apostacy with death or that it tolerates any similar form of coversion of freedom of conscience . all five schools of law to the best of my knowledge support the death sentence for apostasy when it is accompanied by open , persistent , and aggravated hostility to islam . otherwise i agree , there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief . the qur an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience . public or private disavowal of islam or conversion to another faith is not punishable there are some jurists who have gone against this trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable even by death but historically they are the exception . cursing and insulting the prophets falls under the category of shatim .  i just borrowed a book from the library on khomeini's fatwa etc. lots of stuff deleted  and , according to the above analysis , it looks like khomeini's offering of a reward for rushdie's death in fact constitutes a criminal act according to islamic law . please see my post under re yet more rushdie islamic law .
4			cyprus			 now , the genocide of the azeri turks of x soviet armenia and karabag . at last , i hope that the u.s. insists that turkey stay out of the karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never occur again . do you have a terminal cold ? karabag is not urkish and will remain not urkish . here we are , almost at the end of the 20th century , and a whole community , the azeri turks of x soviet armenia and karabag , is facing forced assimilation , torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus , expulsion and genocide on the other , all because of their ethnic and religious background . and one should ask herself is the world community really so powerless ? where are all those human rights advocates ? where are all the decent people ? are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it ? the number of azeris murdered by the terrorist armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing . on the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other , they beg mercy from turkiye . the age . melbourne . 6 3 92 by helen womack . agdam , azerbaijan , thursday the exact number of victims is still unclear , but there can be little doubt that azeri civilians were massacred by armenian fighters in the snowy mountains of nagorno karabakh last week . refugees from the enclave town of khojaly , sheltering in the azeri border town of agdam , give largely consistent accounts of how their enemies attacked their homes on the night of 25 february , chased those who fled and shot them in the surrounding forests . yesterday , i saw 75 freshly dug graves in one cemetery in addition to four mutilated corpses we were shown in the mosque when we arrived in agdam late on tuesday . i also saw women and children with bullet wounds in a makeshift hospital in a string of railway carriages . khojaly , an azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by armenians , had a population of about 6000 . mr. rashid mamedov commander of police in agdam , said only about 500 escaped to his town . so where are the rest ? some might have taken prisoner , he said , or fled . many bodies were still lying in the mountains because the azeris were short of helicopters to retrieve them . he believed more than 1000 had perished , some of cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees . one refugee , rami nasiru , described how khojaly residents at first thought the attack was no more than the routine shooting to which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict . but when they saw the armenians with a convoy of armored personnel carriers , they realised they could not hope to defend themselves with machineguns and grenades , and fled into the forests . in the small hours , the massacre started . mr. nasiru , who believes his wife and two children were taken prisoner , repeated what many other refugees have said that troops of the former soviet army helped the armenians to attack khojaly . it is not my opinion , i saw it with my own eyes . serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ohanus appressian 1919 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . sahak melkonian 1920

5			politics	competition	revenge			 who's next ? mormons and jews ? i merely point out that it is a valid strategy which is used every day . furthermore , we don not know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects . do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges ? just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects ? how far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves ? what do you suggest they can do which can not be faked by the competition ? so instead you are asking individual citizens to place themselves at risk by assuming that everyone who claims to be a cop , actually is a cop . around here the police have actually made public service announcements saying that if you are a lady driving by yourself at night and you see blue lights flashing behind you . do not pull over until you reach a well lit , preferably occupied place , gas station etc. even if you have got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops , that's not an excuse to murder police . it wouldn not be murder , it would be self defense .  mob rule isn not any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government it ain not charity if you are using someone else's money . wilson's theory of relativity if you go back far enough , we are all related .

5			war	torture	murder			 death penalty gulf war add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell block , years of court costs , extra guards . and the benefits of the death penalty entirely disappear .  that's because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death overrides the benefit of all the others . obviously it's tragic , but it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty . if we went to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect , then there is no way to win the war .  yes . fortunately we have right thinking folks like your good self in power , and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oil h h hkuwait . we won the war , hurrah hurrah ! the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news media . the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century ! this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently . the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous . not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died , and they were the ones being targeted ! or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians ? either the smart bombs didn not hit their targets and we know they did , or they were targeting civilian targets ! which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq's military potential . the military mission planners are not fools , they know they have to hit military targets to win a war . hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you , not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant dictator .  ok , so some innocent people died . yes , maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing along that road didn not need to be bombed to bits . perhaps that kid with half his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs weren not entirely guilty . but it's worth the death of a few innocents to save the oil h h hlives of the kuwaiti people , isn not it ? after all , the iraqis may not have had a chance to vote for saddam , but they showed their acceptance of his regime by not assassinating him , right ? all that surrendering and fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy . we were entirely within our rights to bomb em just in case , without finding out if they were soldiers . how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww2 ? i don not hear you bemoaning them ! war is never an exact science , but with smart bombs , it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties . sometimes mistakes are made ; targets are misidentified ; innocents die . that's war the way it really is . but the alternative , to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale , grabbing everything they can get is worse . like patrick henry said some 217 years ago , i know not what course others may take but as for me , give me liberty , or give me death ! war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free .  the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime , but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals , lengthy court battles , etc. have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should be . hence the question is , do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be , and see if that deters crime , or do we get rid of it entirely ?  yes , let's reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be . all that shit about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice . let's give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty , and save ourselves the expense of all those lawyers .  think of the knock on benefits , too . la would never have had to spend so much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops had been allowed to do their job properly . a quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the cameraman , and everyone would have been saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense .  after all , if the police decide a man's guilty , that ought to be enough . the fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment , well , that's entirely irrelevant .   mathew  mathew , your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here . you come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot , although i feel sure that was not your intent . so the iraqi war was wrong , eh ? i m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war , just like it did in ww2 , eh ? i guess we shouldn not have fought ww2 either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg . how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent ? we should have just let hitler take over europe , and you would be speaking german instead of english right now . tyrants like hussein have to be stopped . his kind don not understand diplomacy ; they only understand the point of a gun . my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn not have the military roll into baghdad , so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people's sacrifice not to mention the 357 americans who died was for naught . liberating kuwait was a good thing , but wiping hussein off the map would have been better ! and as for poor , poor rodney king ! did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty ? those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape . but the jury looked at all the evidence , evidence which you and i have not seen . when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides , one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice , a state of mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against , but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen . law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused , whether they be criminals or cops . one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt , and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict . anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism .  regards , jim b .
5			faith	religion	equality	sex			 when are two people married in god's eyes ? to recapitulate a bit the essence of marriage is two people's commitment to each other . if two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state , that's prima facie evidence that the commitment isn not really there . there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible without a civil or church wedding if you are stranded on a desert island , or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason e.g . laws against interracial marriage . the legal concept of common law marriage is meant to ensure that the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the usual ceremony and record keeping . pastorally , i m concerned that people should not use being married in god's eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding . one has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed .  but there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony without making a genuine commitment , and therefore are not married in god's eyes . right ?  michael a . covington , associate research scientist artificial intelligence programs the university of georgia phone 706 542 0358 athens , georgia 30602 7415 u.s.a . amateur radio n4tmi i think the last statement is dangerous . i believe as long as someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage , they have a moral obligation , even if their intention was not right . other people are involved in the marriage covenant . if they believed in good faith that a marriage occurred , then i think there are obligations created to them . of course there are situations where intent can cause a marriage not to exist the classic example is when it's done as part of a play . but these are exceptions , and should be clear to all parties . clh

2			pirate	lacrosse	baseball	pitcher	pitching			 jack morris in any case , i think viola would have made a better signing . why ? viola is younger , and is left handed how many left handed starters does toronto have ? well , i agree that viola is a better signing . however , why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters ? i understand lefthanded spot relievers , even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters . i just don not understand why people insist on lefthanded starters , unless there is a park effect e.g . yankee stadium . most batters in mlb are righthanded , so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters . i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhp's than rhp's . however , this is probably only a factor in the postseason , because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season . i think you just want the best starters you can get , regardless of whether they are lefties or righties . lefthanded starters tend to have higher era's than righthanded starters , precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage . am i missing something here ? craig
3			computer	electricity	energy			 lead acid batteries & concrete ?  i was just wondering one thing , actually two . i hope that this is the proper place to post this subject  why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor ? i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year , to preserve them and i just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work , but they act like the two terminals are shorted . i asked a friend and he said that you should never do that , cause it ruins them , but he couldn not tell me why .  it's not the concrete floor that does it . the problem is that lead acid cells self discharge over time . even high quality cells gates for instance will discharge 50 60 over a 3 5 month period of time . non sealed cells self discharge even faster . if the battery was not completly charged when left sitting , it probably discharged past the the point where cell sulfiding occurs , which in many cases means a ruined battery .  datalog consulting , tucson , az . . noao ! datalog . com ! ejm

5			faith	religion	sect	spirituality	scientology	god			 oto , the ancient order of oriental templars to all whom it may concern  it is known only to a few that there exists an external visible organization of such men and women , who having themselves found the path to real self knowledge , and who , having travelled the burning sands , are willing to give the benefit of their experience , and to act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be guided .  while numberless societies , associations , orders , groups etc. have been founded during the last thirty years in all parts of the civilised world , all following some line of occult study , yet there is but one ancient organization of genuine mystics which shows the seeker after truth a royal road to discover the lost mysteries of antiquity , and to the unveiling of the one hermetic truth .  this organization is known at the present time as the ancient order of oriental templars . ordo templi orientis . otherwise the hermetic brotherhood of light . up to this point , i was kinda hoping that this was a joke . still , it would make a great premise for a bad syndicated tv show these are the adventures of the oriental templars . dedicated to truth , justice , and good karma ! dramatic music in the background . no doubt i have just horribly offended someone .  mike swaim whenever the soft drink machine needs to be restocked , rather than getting angry , disclamer i lie meditate on the impermanence of all things and the emptiness of coke .
5			orthodoxy	religion	ethic	christianity	skepticism	catholicism	islam	christian	controversy			 rw is robert weiss the only orthodox christian ? weiss says  orthodox is a compound word it comes from orthos straight , true , right and from would oxa opinion , doctrine , teaching . i use orthodox to refer to right teaching . right teaching is derived from letting god speak to us through the bible . this can be from reading simple truths in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible . thanks for the etymology lesson , but i actually know what orthodox means . you are avoiding my question , however , which was from what body of theology does your version of orthodoxy come ? you seem to simply be saying that whatever you understand the bible to say is orthodox . ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant ?  i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are pertinent . you are obviously mistaken , since many , many people have read the bible and many do not agree with you on this point . once again , robert , is your interpretation the only correct or orthodox one ? ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is ra challenged , your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra look at the bible in order to see the truth , but what of those who ra see biblical things differently from you ?  i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one views the bible is somehow legitimate , except , or course , for the stuff that i glean from it . put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can have a discussion on that topic . but to decry something that i put forward , without putting forward something else to discuss , and to dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious . this whole string began as a response to your attacks on mormonism ; no one is attacking your personal beliefs , only your tendency to present them as orthodoxy . i don not much care what you believe about the bible ; just don not present you personal understanding as the only orthodox one .  ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra understands it ?  if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is wrong , then please , show me from scripture where it is wrong . simply stating that there are other views is not a proof . show it to me from scripture and then we can go on . i have never attacked your specific beliefs that's your approach , remember ? stating that other people who depend solely on the bible have other views is indeed proof that the bible can be interpreted many ways , which has been my whole point all along . the specifics of your belief are your business ; just don not pretend that they are anything more than your personal intepretation , and be careful about crying heresy based on your private belief system .  robert weiss   rick anderson

1			math	software	hacking	programming	computer			 computer engr vs . computer science a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about $ 5000 meaning the engineer makes $ 5000 more than ps the $ 5000 is not just a joke scott  for the most part , this is a bunch of bunk . i have got a computer engineering degree , yet i have spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually use . moreover , the salary distinctions are incorrect ; i received 3 job offers upon graduation ; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were $ 7000 year lower ! my advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you , and pick the major that allows you to take them .  emt  well here is my $ 0 . 02 worth . advice from a grad student .  i agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me . the important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it .  in my five years of education in this field , though brief compare to alot of people , i had to think about this kind of question a lot . did i make the right decision in going into electrical engineering as opposed to computer engineering or cs ? the more i go thru school , the more i believe that this kind of question is irrelevant .  interesting , as i think computer technology is now becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position which must require a degree . i know of several people i work with that make just as much as i do and they don not even have a bs degree in comp sci . yet they make 28 a year . they also didn not have to pay 30 grand to thier local university either . i think computer programming is being reduced to a trade practice , than a truly specialty field . it will be even more so in the future . if your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you choose cs as i did , i suggest checking out the emerging field of software engineering . the difficulties for example of designing scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment is truly a gigantic problem . not going to be solved any time soon unfortunately . but hey you could be the person that provides the missing key for some good groundwork ! i have come to believe that choosing cs because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something . everything is interwoven and inseparable . cs , ce , and ee are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other .  my advice is don not limit yourself , but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn . that of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school . i would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible . beside , i don not know why the school would make a student choose a major before her his sophamore year .  hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case , you suffer a little more and go to grad school .  about the money . don not look at the averages , if you are good , you are going to earn more money than anyone else . if you are a superstar programmer , you will earn millions . like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers . well , if your like the poor slobs in the world . like me , you are in no financial position to continue graduate work right out of a top 10 comp sci school . the trick is , to find some generous inc you work for to pay for the rest of your education . trust me its the best way to go . even if you don not get a top salary . which i have always been a poor slob throughout school but if you follow this rule book salary food&shelter you should always have a computer and you won not go hungry . what else could a man want ?  chung yang  greg carter

3			computer	programming	hacking			 once tapped , your code is no good any more .  tim may , whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime  isn not this just a little melodramatic ?  not at all . two weeks ago i registered a concern about some programming that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the university of texas at san antonio . as a result , i was interrogated by the capus police , who also attempted to create a positive identification file photo , fingerprints , etc . i refused to permit this , and filed a complaint with the university administration . the vice president for business affairs the boss of the campus police stated that he had no interest in the legal constitutional implications of those actions . a remark i heard the other day is beginning to take on increasingly frightening significance . the comment was made that in other parts of the world the democrats note the big d would be known as socialists we might get further if we begin by accepting that the government really couldn not be bothered less about the political opinions of the right wing pro establishment types . just about the only circumstances in which i could think that they would be interested in their political views would be to recruit them as spooks . they can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts . in us history it has been the socialists such as myself who have been persecuted . now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force lets try thinking . in the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project . therefore this is not a party matter at all . george bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls , he was chief spook remember . secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure . they simply ask their chums who they give huge defense contracts to motorola etc to be nice boys . after all bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips won not be avaliable to foreign firms. thirdly the people who consider the democrats to be socialist are not the same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist people might know this if the us education system did not suffer from the mcarthyite and dewy version of political correctness the sort with tribunals and show trials . ever seen ed meese pissed ? i have , it was when he said that socialism and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter . it took several minutes before we realised that he was serious . phill hallam baker phill hallam baker

 a four  two fasten his arms , one shoots in the face , and one writes up a false report .  making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything not mentioning peace or agreement . i also know several tens of jokes about arabs palestinians but i do not post them to usenet anyway , not to this newsgroup , since i don not think i will achieve any target but making other parts furious , and this is not my target . if this is your target . well . that tells a lot about you . can nick steel provide documentation for this alleged incident ? did you really think he is talking about something realistic ?  harry .  you must be kidding , this is not a single incident now . this has become a daily life practice in gazza if you mean the killing of children by armed soldiers . yeah , well , sometimes , when cowards put their children and wives in the front line , so their enemy cannot do anything , well , maybe in those cases , you have no better thing to do to save your life than shooting . and if parents want their children alive , i think it would be better that before they get out to throw stones molotov botlles , or when they come to kill soliders , to keep their children in the houses . if you are objecting the number of occupying israeli soldiers terrorists or the way they do it , then  look in the dictionary at the word terrorism ! it says nu the use of threats of violence , and violence esp for political purposes . it sounds more like your guys . i caan assure you that they do worse than that . just as yeah ? well , i guess you were in there , and you know it all . example 11 children were killed this month of ramadhan two of them by military vehicules . an other similar incident by vehicule was the one of 25 feb 4 ramadhan where thee military truck on purpose hit a passenger  where from do you know that it was on purpose ? personally , i didn not hear about this case , although i don not deny it . but how can anybody , besides the person itself , can say it was on purpose ? car where the victims were a 5 year girl safa sail bisharat and saamud riyad a 2 weeks old babygirl . the 23 oldd raajij rouhy yeah , sure . the truck driver looked in the car with his zionist equipment of detecting palestinian children , and then he thought to himself hey there is a 5 year and 2 weeks girls in the car . why won not i make an accident and kill the enemy ? maximum i will die too in the crash . but what do i care ?  hakim .  actually , if can remember correctly , was it not reported and even on camera some time during the israeli invasion of lebanon , or when the itifada began , that cnn caught regular uniformed israeli soldiers breaking the arms of some arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner , someone please give full details if they can remember . this is one of the few well , it was about 3 years ago , in the intifada the fact that you can not remember the time prooves how much do you care about it . i do not think that what the soliders did was correct . but i will not agree that they were breaking their arms . i saw that film , and , unlike in the usa , it was broadcasted entirely not long ago in a talk show and at the end the arm broken guys got up and walked and used their arms very good . they guy who did it was interviewed and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take his orders , and spitted in his face . what ammount of truth exist in this statement i cannot tell you , because i wasn not there . but the guy who did it was in prison , if it makes you any good . occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the west and in the usa . it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly changed the preception of the israeli army's role in the mid east no , it didn not . the israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle eastit is still the only human army as much as an army can be human . to any american who will claim the opposite , i can only remember the cnn broadcasting of the american solider who beat a somalian boy . it was very cruel to see . but i won not say because of this that the american army is cruel .  so there is proof for you ! it is obvious that is a systematic policy of the israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes . some kind of proof ! obvious ? where from ? if you say it is behind the scenes , how do you know about it ?  nadeem  i just wanted to show how much garbadge one can say , without knowing anything about what he says , and living a life far away from the place he talks about . livian segal   o   vm cms unix

1			microsoft	windows	crash	disaster	computer	linux			 challenge to microsoft supporters . i would say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare . windows itself almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite ? any one of the corel 3 . 0 programs . on the other hand , i have had os 2 crash randomly a number of times , mostly just running it's own applications . i do know that ibm systems , the ps 2 56slc2 , in particular , have absolutely no problem with os 2 never had a random crash while running any of my programs under os 2 . in fact , i don not remember ever crashing . of course , i really don not run any os 2 programs , just the same bunch of dos and windows stuff that i have always been running . and when i had the 56slc this is the 386slc system running dos windows , i had only one crash , and it was consistent . ftp had a tendency to crash whenever i would get large files 1mb from particularly fast clients dtr's 150k 200k sec , i figured out the problem was with smartdrv's write buffering if i turned off the write buffer , everything would work fine . ftp under os 2 has never locked , though . i can even format floppies to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os 2 . for instance , i m still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp 5 . 1 dos locks up my system . yeah , i guess i m willing to admit that os 2 is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware . wp51 for dos works perfectly fine on my slc2 . please explain . the only time i wait on anything under windows is when i m copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing and even then , not long i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per minute , and can still go do things slowly while it's doing this i have downloaded with pp 9600 while printing . well , i save all my personal files to floppy , and when i did that under windows , a floppy save of a large file hung up the system . i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal computation in the background . and not being able to address your memory better than dos , not sure what you mean here . the idea is that os 2's dos sessions can see more memory than windows dos sessions . i let xpl a shareware calculus program see around 720kb of free conventional memory , which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight dos where it would see around 610kb of conventional ram . i also found it really handy for my own dos based programs , which , without any re writing , could now handle larger data sets , simulate for more iterations , etc. of course , the point is now moot , since the os 2 programs i now write simply never run into memory limitations . i never programmed for windows , so i don not have much of a comparison here , though .

3			electricity	energy	star	galaxy	physic	space	astronomy			 gamma ray bursters how energetic could they be ?   how much energy does a burster put out ? i know energy depends on distance , which is unknown . an answer of the form x ergs per megaparsec 2 is ok .  different spheres r . 25pc oort cloud radius , r 22 . 5pc at the edge of the galaxy , r 183 . 5pc or the edge of the galactic corona , and lastly at a r 8800mpc . for a radius of . 25 pc , we found an l around 10 32 erg sec . pretty energetic for close by . for the coronal model , we found around 10 43 erg sec . and lastly , for the cosmological model an l 10 53 . that's what you would call moderately energetic , i would say . any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second ? jeremy   supernovae put out 10 53 or 10 54 i forget which , but it's only an order of magnitude . not in gamma rays , though . you would hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 mpc , but if a decent fraction of the sn output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic but closer than 9 mpc . i dunno sn theory so well , but i can not think of how to get many gammas out . maybe i should look it up . big radio galaxies can put out 10 46 erg s continually . that's just in the radio . there are a lot of gammas around them , too , but bursts ? nah . neither of these should be taken as explanations . just trying to show that those energies are produced by things we know about . greg
2			pressure	hockey	football	overtime	coaching	competition			 leaf slump over on march 21 , 1993 roger maynard wrote in reply to an article by graham hudson you don not think he is performing under pressure now ? the major differences between playoff hockey and normal hockey is 1 . play ing every other night which is physically exhausting and 2 . you play the same team in a consecutive string of games . is this what you mean by pressure ? have you even thought about what you mean by pressure , or are your thoughts , like most of the rest of this drivel , simply half baked ? this was , for anybody who would like to check . he went on in another article to say paraphrased playoff hockey is just an expression used by announcers to convince simple minded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better product than a regular season game . with a 4 2 win over a tough whaler squad the leafs showed all doubters what playoff hockey is all about .  so , roger , what exactly is playoff hockey all about ? or is it a convenient phrase to use in certain circumstances only ? you see , when you spout off with flame bait too many times , sooner or later it catches up with you . nice try deepak , but tough whaler squad should have clued you in to the fact that my leaf woofing was tongue in cheek . if playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is , some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season . but that is only for some of the players . many of the rest , who have been playing with injuries , who miss their families , or who , like grant fuhr , would really rather be playing golf , don not really give a damn . of course i can not say this for sure , but i believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and i don not think that hockey players are above having what i consider typically human attitudes . with the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs . the ones who regard the playoff take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs . now i know some of you are going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all . while they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose , which is , to make a decent living . of course , the coach is a professional as well , and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players . so , if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort . the second season , is after all , merely an exhibition . the true champions of the league are the division winners , the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season . the stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot . the emphasis on the playoffs , with their sudden death appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind . even if pittsburgh loses the playoffs , we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year . they proved it . cordially , as always , rm  roger maynard

4			equality	prejudice	racist	jew			 volume i think some of you guys think that the volume of your responses and their harshness somehow increases their factual accuracy . i especially deplore the attempts to call me a racist as many of you have done . you guys think just because there are more unreasonable israelis on this pcnews channel than all other denominations combined including reasonable israelis that somehow makes you right . well you are wrong . i just started reading this stuff last sunday and thought i might butt in since there were severe information problem on the part of some people . i thought that through somewhat intelligent conversation we might enlighten each other . that would be nice , but considering professional diplomats between israel and athe arabs have been unable to do so for 45 years , i can not see us starting . but hey as soon as anyone wants to discuss things reasonably and in a scholarly manner , count me in . anyway the responses were mostly negative and i have been called a racist and an anti semite so many times that it seems assumed about me in people's postings . when i shared this with some of my friends it appears that they have had similar experiences . the overall harsh language coupled with the occasional death threats and attempts to get them disconnected have convinced many to look elsewhere for true discussions and unsubscribe to the newsgroup . people have very strong opinions and you need to be careful regarding what you say if you say , make it factual and be able to back it up . i don not know if you are paid israeli lobbyists or just concerned , but it seems that toning down the harsh rhetoric might be more helpful to your cause than name calling , attempting to disconnect and death threats . just a tip about how things work in the civilized world . thanks for teaching us about the civilized world , andi . i guess we all just came out either the desert or the ghetto , right ? and no , we are not paid israeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the zog we are just people who believe in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing or disloyalty due to our love of israel disguised as paid israeli lobbyists what kind of image is that ? ps i understand that not all of you are involved in all this but many of you are contributing to the atmosphere . p . ps just to clear up something , i don not think than the jews are necessarily any worse than other people as a whole if such a distinction between cultures shall be made i don not personally believe in judging people by their religion , culture or race . oh ! thank you ! i needed your approval of my heritage . i guess i can go home and feel good now and sleep comfartably knowing that jews really aren not worse people than anyone else , contrary to what we all know is true . ed .

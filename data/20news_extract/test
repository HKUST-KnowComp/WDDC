3			link	circuit			 ir remote control receiver for a project of my own , i would like to build a infra red remote control receiver for regular vcrs and tvs remotes . does anybody have any info or tips on how to build such receiver ? in particular , a which photo detector should i use which wavelength do remotes use ? b which ics or circuit should i use ? c any suggestions for circuit layout please reply to this group if you wish , but as well via email my link to usenet is not always available . i would like to see this info as well . as for wavelength , i think you are primarily going to find two 880 nm a bit , and or 950 nm a bit . usually it is about 10 nm either way . the two most common i have seen were 880 and 950 but i have also heard of 890 and 940 . i m not sure that the 10 nm one way or another will make a great deal of difference . another suggestion find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote , and go look at the sams photofact for it . you can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well , including carrier freq . specs . and tone decoding specs . if the system uses that . duane
5			christian	mr.			 request for support i have a request for those who would like to see charley wingate respond to the charley challenges and judging from my email , there appear to be quite a few of you . it is clear that mr. wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges themselves . between the last two re postings of the challenges , i noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by mr. wingate , none of which answered a single challenge . it seems unmistakable to me that mr. wingate hopes that the questions will just go away , and he is doing his level best to change the subject . given that this seems a rather common net . theist tactic , i would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers , in the following manner 1 . ignore any future articles by mr. wingate that do not address the challenges , until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so . or 2 . if you must respond to one of his articles , include within it something similar to the following please answer the questions posed to you in the charley challenges . really , i m not looking to humiliate anyone here , i just want some honest answers . you wouldn not think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout christian , would you ? nevermind , that was a rhetorical question . dave wood

3			cipher	key	algorithm			 subliminal channels in dss may i suggest that any any proposed cipher system having less entropy than the user's key and message can have an embedded subliminal channel as big as the difference in entropies between the entropy of the user input message and the entropy of the output ? for example , take plain des . the unsuspecting user inputs a string plaintext to be enciphered . he cranks the algorithm which has been hacked by george quisling and comes out with j 3h4902d . nine char in and nine chars out . right ? the unsepecting user ships the ciphertext to be decrpyted and the message plaintext is produced . everything fine , right ? nope . imagine the algorithm did a lz compression on plaintext before desing . compressing is down to four characters with more entropy 9 wj the opponent now pads the message with his own message , also compressed 3dk before applying des to the concatenated compressed pairs . when decrpyted , the first compressed message is stripped off and declared sent . unbeknowst to the receiver , the opponents accomplice collects the remaining message in the bit bucket and uncompresses to kill now . and to prevent all such subliminal or covert storage channels you would need to have maximal entropy all the time which is a priori impossible because for example a stereotypical message might be replaced by one bit in the output reserving the rest of the output bits for the long covert message . in other words , if you opponent get to muck with the algorithm you either have got to muck with it last or concede his possible embedding of covert channels . in other words , if you present a message to an opponet with less than maximal entropy then you have given him free bits of storage .  2ef221 15 e2 ad d3 d1 c6 f3 fc 58 ac f7 3d 4f 01 1e 2f

4			passage	compound	building	peter	disease	assault	tank	suicide	gang	gun			 waco thirdly , it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given the benefit of hindsight something that those who made the decisions did not have the benefit of . why not give them the courtesy of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the data they had in a very , very difficult situation . what is your proof that they did the best they could ? unless they had strong evidence that the children were in immediate danger then the best they could have done was to show restraint . some of us did predict this outcome , or at least suggested a strong possibility of it . i , for one , said that in the event of an assault against the building the children were the ones in danger either from the assault itself or from a jonestown my phrase a week after the seige started style suicide . and as i pointed out then , and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net who disagreed with me , an adult may freely choose suicide but they have no right to impose this choice on their children . now , while i don not expect the fbi to pay any attention to what i have to say on this , i do expect them to figure it out on their own or to take the advice of experts . the cult specialist inter viewed in yesterday's boston globe said he was repeatedly stonewalled by the fbi when he pointed out to them that their confrontational tactics played perfectly into koresh's mad view of the world and so increased the chance of a tragic outcome . some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound give me a break . give us a break ! pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound filled with children ? this doesn not seem to show much regard for their lives or safety . nontoxic teargas is an oxymoron . children have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions induced by teargas ; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone subject to laryngospasms , asthma , or heart disease . if a madman is holding a gun to a hostage , someone who provokes the madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the death of the hostage as the madman himself . these kinds of situations have to be handled delicately not by surrounding a place with tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud speakers at all hours . that approach is idiotic . be part of the solution not the problem . the solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the the authorities . the feds showed themselves here , as they have so many times in the past , to be a gang of trigger happy , impulsive , yahoos who cause more trouble than they prevent . their confrontational approach reinforced every single message koresh was giving his followers , virtually guarantee ing that whatever crazy solution koresh proposed would be followed willingly . this was pointed out here , on compuserve , in the press , just about every place except in the justice department where it seems a n . i . h . philosophy prevails .   peter

3			flight	atmosphere	customer	technology	engineer	spacecraft	condition	space	russian	launch	concept	february	orbit			 space advertising 2 of 2 x sender newtout 0 . 08 feb 23 1993 two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993 . first , in february , the russians deployed a 20 m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station . while this banner reflector was blank , npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers , who could use a space based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial , as filmed from the mir . the second development , has been that space marketing inc , the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft , is now pushing the environmental billboard . as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory , the environmental billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters . advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area , deployed by the inflatable frame . to help sell the concept , the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the earth's delicate protective ozone layer , according to mike lawson , head of smi . furthermore , the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re enter the earth's atmosphere . according to imi , as the biodegradable material burns , it will release ozone building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer . the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it , too , re enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply . this would not be a cheap advertisement , costing at least several millions of dollars exact costs were not available . but smi estimates that market exposure would be 3 5x that of the people who watched the superbowl , where a 30 second advertising unit cost $ 600 , 000 . since smi is located in atlanta , georgia , it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta .  but back to brian's questions and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip ? how serious is this project ? is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding ?  see above . as for serious if they can get $ 15 20 m or so my estimate of $ 5 10 for development costs and a flight unit , plus $ 10 15 m for a launch , then it's probably real . they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can not piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch . that's a $ 10 15 m cost they need to raise , right there . and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well . note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already . while i don not think the legal challenges would win out and yes , i am an amateur astronomer , and no , i don not really like the idea of this additional light pollution , but i know of no prohibition of it . the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising . i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure , and negate the space advertising advantage . would you spend $ 15 m to look like an idiot ? and light pollution might not be too bad if it's in a low enough orbit , and it relies upon reflected light only , it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn . for maximum market exposure , you want to have it visible just after dusk minimizing impact on astronomy , since that's the time of worse seeing due to day night thermal turbulence . it might still be a problem , but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this . as for having real funding none that i can identify . there were about 60 expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity , but that included curious folks and was for only a $ 500 , 000 commitment . i haven not heard of any serious funding for this , but i m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more . but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time .  and if anybody wants to cross post this to sci . astro , please be my guest i don not have posting privileges to that area or at least i don not think i do .  wales larrison space technology investor maximus 2 . 01wb

4			passage	russia	constitution	state	context	defense			 we are from the government and we are here to help you historical examples and the us constitution    ouch , now that really hurts . i m being accused of no breadth nor depth to my historical knowledge because i m unwilling to agree that economic inequality leads to poverty and from there to social and political instability . you go read your history again . poverty is the main engine of social instability in this context , we will put aside religious turmoil , mass migrations , etc . well , the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to social and political instability , while economic inequality is much more strongly related . in virtually all major revolutions including england the puritan revolution , france , russia and china , the revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term growth and poverty was declining . what sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible . if poverty were the main engine of social instability , this typical historical pattern would not hold . in fact , revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time . much deleted . gee , jim , if you will check the constitution you will find in order to . promote the general welfare . do ordain and establish this constitution . i m surprised you missed it . it's right there in the first paragraph . i would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble .  you almost got it right , and it was a good try , but you should follow your own advice . the preamble to the constitution does read as you have quoted but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble . it is not a binding part of the constitution and carries no weight in the law . that poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages in the english language witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land . do you really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution ? sorry , buddy , but some other blowhards managed to include the general welfare in another portion of the constitution . article i section 8 the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes . to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states . i guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble . just to make sure you have got the point , let's do a little experiment . what if the constitution read as follows ?  preamble we the people , to promote the general welfare , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america .  constitution the federal government shall have one function and one function only to provide for the defense of the nation .  but as noted above , the constitution doesn not say that , does it ? the government would not then have two functions defense and welfare . but since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense functions . right ? jsh  steve hendricks domain one thing about data , it sure does cut uucp . uunet ! isc br ! thor ! steveh the bulls t . r . hofferbert ma bell 509 838 8826

5			passage	interpretation	tradition			 islam and scientific predictions was x mailer psilink dos 3 . 3  his conclusion was that , while he was impressed that what little the holy qur an had to say about science was accurate , he was far more impressed that the holy qur an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions . how would a man of 7th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy qur an assuming he had authored it ?  well , it looks like the folks in soc . religion . islam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking interest topic . a few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned . these may be hard to find , but i think i may take a stab at it out of curiosity . i know the one film i saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes i have seen which were used to show science in the koran which i posted here were also pretty vague . i suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have . at least one poster on the islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the koran to decide what is good science . i wonder if islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the christians creation science on any topic . it would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the koran , to see if anyone used the koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded . it is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then interpret passages to match those findings . people do similar things with the sayings of nostradamus all the time . anyway , it is a rather unique claim of islam and may be worth checking .
1			manufacturer	space			 com4 card shows up as com3 with com4's address and irq ! com port gurus , help ! i have an internal modem that i configure as com4 with irq 3 , but when i insert that card into my dos 5 . 02 pc , it shows up as com3 , with irq3 and com4's address 2e8 !  when i get into debug , and dump the data at 40 0 , it shows the address 2e8 as belonging to com3 even though the modem should be at com4 . . this is a common misconception , shared my many manufacturers , programmers , and users alike . com3 , for example , is simply the third equipped comm port , not necessarily the one with i o address 3e8 . the bios just searches sequentially through a set of potential comm port addresses . the first equipped port it finds will become com1 , etc. if you are playing by the rules , you can not have a com4 unless you have a com3 equipped . the set of standard whatever that means port addresses merely reflects the order in which the bios searches the i o address space in its search for serial ports . so , what you have is indeed com3 at the non standard address 2e8 . were this address in the 4th table slot instead , programs which query the bios to determine the number of installed comm ports would not find it , as the field in the bios data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 comm ports installed . frankly , i don not know of a simgle program that would actually have a problem with this .  bob nichols at&t bell laboratories
3			cryptography	clipper	encryption	wiretap	cipher	nsa	crypto	key	technique			 how to detect use of an illegal cipher ? your honour , the suspect suddenly started using another level of cryptography and we can not tap his phone calls any more . he must have something to hide . please sign the warrant to search his house . what they would need to do , though , is make sure that nobody has access to decent crypto in the first place . they probably can not tell clippered voice from clippered triple desed voice until they get their copy of your key . any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of clipper . the only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption . i probably shouldn not say this , but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext . an old fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre encryption , which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input . a countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice . you can tell if the nsa built this feature in blow on the mike , and observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling . pgp 2 key by finger or email eli

4			fire	waco	compound	batf	building	murder	window	agency	explanation	jesus	arm			 batf fbi murders almost everyone in waco today ! 4 19 and i suppose the fbi also prevented them from coming out with their hands up while national tv cameras watch .  watch from where ? two miles away ? far enough away that whatever really happenned must be explained through the vengeful filter of a humiliated agency that said quote ! enough is enough .  please tell me what you think would have happened had the people come out with their hands up several weeks ago .  it didn not happen . and who is responsible for it not happening ? certainly not the children . koresh was calling the shots . he was talking with his lawyer and the fbi . since others were released safely , there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound . scenario that is simplest and most plausible . i do not generally believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely scenarios .  the fbi sent letters to martin luther king's wife insinuating that mlk was having an affair ! again , please tell us exactly how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government .  more than someone who would not release children from the compound .  obviously . you are an authority worshiper . not at all . are you a koresh worshiper ? i.e . more than david koresh vernon howell jesus christ . i saw lengthy excerpts from an australian documentary made in 1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult .  give me a camera , and time with you , and i can present excerpts that show you to be a cult leader . guarenteed . thanks for my laugh of the day ! definitely a very silly supposition . you should at least view the whole documentary before you claim it as a source . i would if i could . the news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the compound in 1992 . i am not pleased with the batf handling of the affair . i think they bungled it badly from the start . but i don not think they are responsible for the fire , which started in two different places .  two places , eh ? you saw this ? or did the wonderful fbi tell you this ? i saw one place . i believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site . a fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two story window shown on the tv coverage . the batf is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair . but to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is ludicrous .  i suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to risk small arms fire to get some good footage . these people were told to get the hell out of camera range . why ?  couldn not answer this one , eh ? this is the most important question of all , it is the root cause of all the other suspicion . i thought about mentioning how reagan and the military treated the press in grenada and how that set the precedent , but decided it wasn not worthy of discussion . if the news reporter got shot , you can bet his family would sue the government for letting him into the danger area . the root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn not flee a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took to burn down . or why didn not they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced ? i can find no rational explanation for their behavior .
5			mary	grace	christ	god	sin	being	testament			 mary's assumption i hate to sound flippant , having shot off my mouth badly on the net before , but i m afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that the assumption of mary would be better phrased our assumptions about mary . in all the time i have been reading about mary on this group , i can not recall reading much about mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant , if any , scriptural foundation . i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ's parents as compellingly human persons ; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to god's working , beyond doubt . but the almalga mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures , untouched by sin or human desire . only christ himself was so truly sanctified , and even he knew temptation , albeit without submitting to it . i also don not see the necessity of saying the holy parents were some how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god's grace in being incarnated through an or dinary human being . i won not start yelling about how people are worshipping mary , etc . since folks have told me otherwise about that , but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god's incarnation in christ when we make his parents out to be sinless , sexless , deathless , otherworldly beings .   paul marxhausen . . . . university of nebraska lincoln . . . . . . . . grace . . . happens .
4			fire	gun	improvement	crime	handgun			 guns in backcountry ? no thanks wrong about the whole guns for protection mindset , it ignores the systemic effects of cumulative individual actions . if you want fire insurance on your house that's prudent and it has no effect on me ; but if you and a bunch of other paranoids are packing handguns in the backcountry it makes me , and anyone else who doesn not chose to protect himself in this manner , pretty f king nervous . why ? if you are not a threat , you are not affected at all . i mean , take this to its logical conclusion , suppose we all carried handguns all the time , for protection from all the other people carrying handguns . would we collectively be , or feel , safer ? hell no. we would feel a lot more insecure . why ? i note that the available psych info says that feelings of security increase . the victimization stats say that that increase is rational . another systemic effect of all the good people protecting themselves is that the bad people are going to modify their behavior in response yes , they are , but how ? they are going to be much itchier and much more willing to kill people in the course of routine muggings if they think their nope that doesn not happen . instead the switch among those who change behaviors to property crimes . that's an improvement even if the economic take is unchanged . sure not everyone switches , but they were killing before . andy

2			team	hockey	league	puck	player	goalie	game	nhl			 plus minus stat 1 . you have completely missed the point with the selke trophy . it goes to the best defensive forward this is the forward who forgoes points to help his team out defensively . it is an unsung hero of sorts . yes , lemieux and gilmour are good defensive players , but they play a more offensively oriented style than a true defensive forward this year ,  you mean guys that check but can not score ? the guys who can both check and score shouldn not be candidates ? is that right ? the selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored not to score them . when lemieux or gilmour play their number one purpose is to score defence is secondary especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one . that is why they are not selke candidates . 2 . when tarasov called bob gainey the best player in the world , it was assumed that he meaned the best technical player the one who knew every intricacy about playing hockey and never made a technical error .  and who was it that made this assumption ? all of your friends maybe ? sorry greg , but 2 people aren not enough . you can assume all that you want to , but if you think tarasov was serious then you are an idiot . someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation it was a few months ago . whoever this was please repost it . i agree with this assessment . bob gainey may have been the best technical player ever .  right greg . did you see this in the sun or something ? what did you think of claude provost ? gainey was nothing more than a journeyman player who's outstanding abilities were entirely political . he might have had a col lection of defensive skills but he had absolutely no offensive skills at all . none . but perhaps you think that the abilities to pass the puck , shoot the puck and deke a goalie or defenseman are not technical skills ? gainey is the best defensive forward ever . i stand by that assessment . he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame . did you ever watch him play ? he never made a technical error . babbling deleted gee greg , the pundits were calling gilmour the best two way player in the league way back when he was with st louis . i would have expected you to have picked up on that . who are these pundits ? gilmour was good with st louis but he was not the best two way player in the game when he was with them . you have overhyped gilmour on this net for months . he is a very good forward but hardly the best in the nhl . gregmeister

4			weapon	police	waco	ranger	assault	team	enemy	gun	batf			 raid justification was blast them next time forgot to leave in his quote source what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf . if they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened . the batf is a part of the dept . of treasury , not justice . if they needed to assault a place they could just do like the irs does . call in the federal marshalls service , their fugitive collection teams do similar type assaults all the time . and they are very , very good about it , in both the tactical and legal parts of it . but i suspect that the marshalls would not have touched it , because the search warrant which is still sealed i believe was so bogus . service ; fbi ; secret service ; national park service ; texas rangers ; nearby large city police forces ; the military . but they had to use their own guys , nobody elses swat team was good enough for the holy cause of gun control . i also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting . initial raid two days before the nj senate was going to overturn their assault weapon confiscation law ; a couple weeks before the batf's budget was going to come up in congress for review ; shortly after reno got confirmed as ag i don not need to remind you about her anti gun line ; right around the presidents 100th day in office . as a wise man once said once is happenstance , twice is coincidence , three times is enemy action . i don not believe that these four things are conincidental . do you ? food for thought . dale farmer

1			resolution	format			 fractals ? what good are they ? in regards to fractal commpression , i have seen 2 fractal compressed movies . they were both fairly impressive . the first one was a 64 gray scale movie of casablanca , it was 1 . 3mb and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video . it was a little grainy but not bad at all . the second one i saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1 . 2mb . i consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore . but unlike many other formats out there , you do end up losing resolution . i don not know what kind of software hardware was used for creating the movies i saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5 15 minutes per frame to generate . but as i said above playback was 10 or more frames per second . and how else could you put 11 minutes on one floppy disk ? my opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case i will probably change my mind .

5			angeles	fallacy	context	faith	procedure	los	reasoning	resident	puck	hockey			 rawlins debunks creationism creationist nonsense john e . king posts a whopping one liner the modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be treated as a matter of faith . francis hitching i have a few points to make about the above posting . 1 . science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either real or alleged experts . critical reasoning , evidence and if possible experimentation are necessary . creationists frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quoting both non experts and experts alike some of the latter quotes are in fact false and steadfastly refusing to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure . this strongly suggests that a . their claims completely lack any scientific merit and b . they are aware of this fatal deficiency . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 2 . you have failed to identify hitching and the surrounding context of his statement . why is that ? if hitching is a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology . creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientists . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 3 . evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody . it is also important to note that disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid . creationists seem rather fond of diving head first into this logical fallacy . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 4 . since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack on evolution either the fact or the theory really represents an attack on science . while the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve b the fact of evolution will not ever go away . creationists lost the battle long ago more than 100 years in fact but are simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant . warren kurt vonroeschlaub asks neither i , nor webster's has ever heard of francis hitchings . who is he ? i , like hitchings , am not to be found in webster's b . francis hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist or perhaps he is just playing the part of one who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution the neck of the giraffe . in that publication he quotes a creationist jean sloat morton using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance . thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution the two are quite independent but also concluding with a non sequitur i.e. the conclusion does not follow . pp 70 71 hitchings also misquotes richard lewontin in an effort to support creationism . pp 84 hitchings book was reviewed by national park service ecologist david graber in the los angeles times and repeated in the oregonian . the article was titled giraffe sticks scientific neck out too far . excerpts include francis hitchings is not a biologist he goes after darwin like mark antony after brutus . he flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo science with the sinuosity of a snake oil salesman . he suggests a mystical organizing principle of life , using the similarity of organs in different creatures as evidence sic . note that the last statement above is actually evidence for evolution not against it . if john e . king is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn not surprise me much . it's also interesting that king had nothing to add i.e. he only posted a quote . uucp uunet ! tektronix ! sail ! mikec or m . cranford uunet ! tektronix ! sail . labs . tek . com ! mikec principal troll arpa mikec resident skeptic csnet teklabs , tektronix

4			officer	army	los	nasa	angeles			 abolish selective service the selective service registration should be abolished . to start with , the draft is immoral . whether you agree with that or not , we don not have one now , and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior with a volunteer army than with draftees . finally , the government has us on many lists in many computers the irs , social security admistration and motor vehicle registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to . maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time . let's axe this whole department , and reduce the deficit a little bit .  i m really surprised clinton hasn not already tried to do this . he seems to want to tackle other irrelevant issues first , so why not this one as well . considering that clinton received a draft notice and got out of it he admits it the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would be inclined to risk any extra exposure on .  let me say this about that , as a retired navy officer ;  i agree . cut it . but let's not stop there .  eliminate the c 17 transport .  wrong . we need its capability . sure it has its problems , very few airplanes haven not , but getting rid of something we need is not the answer . what do you want to do , start over a rebuild a new airplane from scatch ? it will have its problems as well and there will be calls again , for it to be scrapped . the other option is to try to extend the life of the c 5s and c 141s that are getting extremely old . if you read aviation week , the c 5 line can be reopened and the c 5s would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the program . politically , though , the c 17 is popular pork .  scrap the seawolf ssn 21 nuclear submarine . ground the b 2 stealth bomber .  it will cost jobs , but i m for it . we especially don not need a b 2 . the ssn 21 , i know litttle about .  agreed . congress took money from nasa and fha to fund the second seawolf . the shipyards are still building los angeles class submarines and there is a lack of asw foes to contend with . the navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 navy times and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current los angeles class . politically , general dynamics is in connecticut and we will get seawolf subs whether we need them or not . in addition , more bases need to be closed . probably long beach naval station and others . the navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships . the question is whether les aspin and clinton will be able to face down a pork happy congress . marc mueller

3			resolution	technology			 can radio freq . be used to measure distance ? i m wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver ?  seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance . this would be for short distances 2000 ft , and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so .  this would be susceptible to fading , multi path etc. we used to use a system at the shop made by tellurometer in south africa . it used a 10 ghz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured . the 10 ghz was just the carrier the real signals were several switched ones around 7 . 5 mhz or so , whose relative phases at the receiver would read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed . the units came with psychrometers sp ? to measure the relative humidity and instructions for correction of the measurements due to rh and temp . they were rather heavy and required an operator at each end . current technology uses polarized reflectors , dual polaization tx rx and psuedo random coding of a radar pulse . about the same resolution at x band , much better at 47ghz . only one end is heavy .  regards , stu beal , ve3mwm , national water research institute , burlington , ontario , canada .  we would made it through yet another nuclear winter and the lawn had just trapped and eaten it's first robin . kyle j . spiller

this is my body . mark 14 22 , cf matthew 26 26 , luke 22 19 , 1 corinthians 11 24 the mode is imperative greek labete , and hence this , too , is a commandment . in both cases we have to infer that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples because we judge the evangelist's point in mentioning it with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead is that we are expected to follow this as a commandment from our lord in the case of communion , paul's mention at least ; this is probably true of the evangelists also implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to bind christians to the original command to his disciples , as a continuing commandment to the christian community . i am entirely comfortable with this inference , but i must point out that it is there , between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command . i take it as a clear inference , at the very least the evangelist's notion , that all christians are called to love one another , in jesus command directed at the disciples . but i have to call attention to the inference . the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of christ all reading of scripture has to make such inferences , to get any sense out of the text whatsoever . this is a general problem in reading these texts we cannot read them at all without our own understanding of our native languages in which we normally read the translated texts , and without some appreciation of the original context and at points , the original languages , when english misleads us . i am going to presume , in what follows , that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control i don not really think this is true , but it will suffice for my current purposes . i will address only the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in . questions at that level only introduce more reser vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done . among the reasons we have for seeing john's agapate allelou as a general commandment not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that one occasion , and one linking it to the synoptic great commandment is that we have criticism , from jesus , about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with . in matthew 5 43ff we read , you have learnt how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy . but i say to you love your enemies . in fact , the leviticus context quoted does not say hate your enemy it is merely the common human presumption . and leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers amongst the people of israel . luke , in expanding on this same q context , goes on to have jesus say . even sinners love those who love them . 6 27 all of this suggests quite strongly , i would say that limiting the scope of the new commandment is not quite what jesus has in mind . in short , inference leads me to generalizing the actual text to a command that is in force on christians , and with objects not limited to other christians . trickier than the agapate allelou or institution of communion , there is the case of the great commission where matthew 10 , mark 6 the twelve are sent out to evangelize , proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand . the verb is imperative ke russete , but the context is rather specific to the twelve , and there are further specifiers as in do not turn your steps to pagan territory , and do not enter any samaritan town the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus final journey to jerusalem which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians than the previous examples . that hasn not prevented christians from making such an inference ; what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the text , nor unlike the first two cases i cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader . still , paul seems to have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand even contrary to jesus instructions to the 12 to the gentiles , to the ends of the earth . so , christians after him have also taken this as a commandment in the sense of john 14 15 . do i accept this ? i don not know . it is surely rather speculative . but you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext christians may infer a general commandment , applicable to all , from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion . i do not necessarily object to this kind of generalization but i insist that people who make it must have an understanding that they are reasoning at some considerable length from what we actually have in scripture . there are assumptions involved in this reasoning , and these are not themselves scriptural though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by other references to scripture which simply adds more inference into the mix ! let's move on to the great commandment that we should love god with our whole hearts and minds and souls . this is , perhaps , the synoptic equivalent of john's agapate allelou . and yet , it is not presented as a commandment , in our texts . rather , the context is controversy with the pharisees . to cite matthew 22 34ff but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they got together and , to disconcert him , one of them put a question , master , which is the greatest commandment of the law ? it is by no means obvious here though i accept it as such that jesus answer is meant to be a commandment to christians . he is answering a polemic from his enemies . mark's account , in 12 28 34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as so the scribe in this version says far more important than any holocaust i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice ; forget the nazis for this or sacrifice . luke is intermediate he has a lawyer posing the question to disconcert jesus , and gets the good samarian parable for his pains luke 10 25 37 . the contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing no inferences in no account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on christians though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus thinks it to be so . the point is that our mental gears have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to do , by jesus . and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of jesus use of the torah in the all quite different gospel accounts , and the application of such a context to us . the different contexts among the synoptics are curious . it should be noted that only in luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of the good samaritan . we may look for an analogous intent in matthew , where 7 12 gives the golden rule as the meaning of the law and the prophets and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same , a generation before jesus . if we make these associations which i think are entirely reasonable , we are again indulging in inference . the texts do not explicitly support us ; rather , we read the texts as having this kind of inter relationship . current literary theory calls this intertextuality . my discussion of why the agapate allelou has to apply beyond the community of the disciples , and beyound the circle of christian believers , applies again here , to buttress a conclusion that this is despite the presentation not saying so explicitly a commandment to christians . few christians would disagree with my conclusions but i must point out that they are conclusions , they depend on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts , themselves . the contextual problem keeps coming up , more and more severely as we look at those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as commandments . and we get some really hard cases . take divorce . mark is pretty clear , the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her . 10 11 , cf luke 16 18 except that matthew has an escape clause except in the case of fornication , 5 31 . this seems to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take matthew's reservation ; and some christians , to this day , take it so . but some don not , at least in practice . this is rather peculiar ; it is not as if jesus were not explicit about this whereas he says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over . how is it possible , if the commands of christ are clear , that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition ? i m going to continue this examination , into ever murkier waters , but this is enough to start with . the theme is finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference ; our inferences are informed by our assumptions , that is , our own cultural biases . i have , so far , identified a very few commandments that are generally accepted by all christians and yet in these , already , some of the difficulties start to surface . it is these difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic . the divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn me with , spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc . couples or misc . legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce , or demanding that us law refuse to allow it , or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in their churches . that is not to say that divorce doesn not enter into consideration in general it is most definitely a matter of concern , in even the most liberal church circles . for example , a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence , in a wildly liberal diocese , has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge , so that the public ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials who would just as soon not take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as christians . this , in a church that was effectively created by a famous divorce !  michael l . siemon i say you are gods , sons of the most high , all of you ;

3			industry	exhaust	regulation	technology			 what do nuclear site's cooling towers do ? great explaination , however you left off one detail , why do you always see them at nuclear plants , but not always at fossil fuel plants . at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle , whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water . as i recall the water isn not as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants , and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination . actually the reasons you don not see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1 fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants . 300 mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built . the average nuclear plant is 1000 mwe . 2 many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can not harm anything , let em go . 3 powered draft cooling towers , low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site , are quite popular with fossil plants . 4 fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears . actually , fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants . there's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology . so it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible . hence big cooling towers . oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers , but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water , not most of the way down to ambient . some plants do cool the condensers with water , rather than air ; as one canadian official , asked about thermal pollution de icing a river , said , up here , we view heat as a resource . actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size . the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from . condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine . the condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature . it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes . the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes . since the condenser is at a very low pressure , the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity . if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low , the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate . this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs . the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps . how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell . typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped . when the river water temperature is high in the summer , operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head . there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area . at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air , the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers . the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity . it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees . a vast difference from the typical 95 95 days 95 degrees , 95 humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual , particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant , for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure . everybody runs closed cycle boilers . the water used is purified of solids , which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils . purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it , so the boiler water is recycled . true . actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves . the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water . by impure , i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen . secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory . john  john de armond , wd4oqc interested in high performance mobility ? performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computers ? marietta , ga send ur snail mail address to for a free sample mag lee harvey oswald where are ya when we need ya ?
2			leaf	detroit	game	team	state	wing	score			 leafs vs wings in last nights game toronto received five penalties , detroit none . if    which game were you watching ? didn not you see the third period when the wings had 2 penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty ? the leafs had a 2 man advantage for about a minute and a 1 man advantage for another minute or two and the leafs still couldn not score . and i wonder how the leafs scored a powerplay goal if , according to you , they never had a powerplay . in the detroit paper today , it said there were 40 penalties called in last night's game . and you are saying detroit had none of those penalties ? i m guessing you only watched the first period . i have to admitt the leafs did get alot of penalties in that period where as the wings didn not get many if any at all haven not looked at the box scores yet . but , the ref more than made up for it in the third period .  laurie marshall wayne state university detroit , michigan go wings ! my apologies for the typo i meant the wings had 5 power plays in the first period and the leafs none . as well , my point isn not that the refs were biased , just that they were calling a lot of penalties , which works to the benefit of the wings . having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game .

2			talent	cup	detroit	game	league	team	season	wing	playoff			 wings will win lots of debate about the virtues of bryan murray vs pat quinn as a gm deleted . randy graca seems to think murray is the best gm in the league . i think quinn is one of several who are better . plus his team quinn's has improved a much greater amount than detroit since he took over with them .  how do you figure ? both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year they both won their division , they had close to the same number of points , they both went down 3 1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in 7 games , and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat , with less talent . specifically , if i remember correctly , third place teams . how does this make vancouver more improved ? further , if i m not mistaken , the wings had more points than vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many . when quinn took over vancouver several years ago , not last year , they regularily missed the playoffs . i can not recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did . quinn has improved the team from non playoff calibre to a serious contender . when murray took over in detroit , the were about a . 500 team that was a contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup contender . so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm . quinn is one example of a better gm than murray . gregmeister

5			marriage	mission	christianity	tradition	christian	angel	truth	church	concern	christ	god	religion	doctrine			 pantheism & environmentalism . does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned unintentionally , of course into pantheism ? i have debated this quite a bit , and while i think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing , i can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous . many pagans are involved in environmentalism this is only natural , since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations . this doesn not mean that environmentalism is wrong , any more than supporting peace in the middle east is wrong because jews and muslims also work for it . nonetheless , paganism is certainly on the rise , and we as christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to christianity . like it or not , pagan religions are addressing needs that christianity should be , and isn not . i believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that christianity has forgotten . this doesn not mean that paganism is right , but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement . first , paganism respects the feminine . christianity has a long history of oppressing women , and many if not most male christians are still unable to live in a non sexist manner . the idea that god is sexless , or that christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission , is met with a great deal of resistance . this insistance on a male dominated theology and the male dominated society that goes with it drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches . second , paganism respects the physical world . this is an idea with great ramifications . one of these is environmentalism respect for our surroundings and our world . another is integration of sexuality . christianity has a long tradition of calling all sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality . this is too much sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option . christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic , and paganism is an attractive option . i m not advocating that christian doctrines no sex before marriage , etc. should be changed just that christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality . denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to god . alan terlep incestuous vituperousness oakland university , rochester , mi melissa eggertsen rushing in where angels fear to tread .

3			wing	satellite	mechanism			 gamma ray bursters . where are they ? what evidence indicates that gamma ray bursters are very far away ?  given the enormous power , i was just wondering , what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by ?  why would they have to be at galactic ranges ?  my own pet theory is that it's flying saucers entering hyperspace  but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes , i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in .  pat well , lets see . i took a class on this last fall , and i have no notes so i will try to wing it . here's how i understand it . remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars pulsars are formed from high mass stars , m star 1 . 4m sun . high mass stars live fast and burn hard , taking appoximately 10 5 10 7 years before going nova , or supernova . in this time , they don not live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane , so any of these if assumed to be the sources of grb's will be in the plane of the galaxy . then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system , pioneer venus has one , either pion . 10 or 11 , ginga , and of course batse and we do distribution tests on our catalog . these tests all show , that the bursts have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction , and they show signs of homogeneity , i.e. they do not clump in any one direction . so , unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy , we are sampling the universe . not cool , if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things . now , i suppose you are saying , well , we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk . well , not necessarily . remember , we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond pluto pioneer 11 , so we should be able , with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite . here's an analogy you see a plane overhead . you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system . one of your friends a mile away sees the same plane , and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system , which is the same as yours . the two angles are different , and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst , and maybe find a source . to my knowledge , no one has been able to do this . i should throw in why halo , and corona models don not work , also . as i said before , looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts , short timescales , high energy black holes , and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior . if this is the case , as i said before , these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy , especially the most energetic of the these sources . when you look at a simulated model , where the bursts are confined to the disk , but you sample out to large distances , say 750 mpc , you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction , but a clumping of sources in the direction of the galactic center . as i said before , there is none of these characteristics .  i think that's all of it . if someone needs clarification , or knows something that i don not know , by all means correct me . i had the honor of taking the bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these different distributions , so we pretty much kicked around every possible distribution there was , and some very outrageous sources . colliding pulsars , black holes , pulsars that are slowing down . stuff like that . it's a fun field . complaints and corrections to or post here . jeremy

 ms. myers just due to scheduling conflicts . so as we put out , the president will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2 00 pm in the rose garden , as opposed to 10 00 am the only other things on his schedule today are at 11 00 am he will meet with general vessey , who , as you know , is on his way to vietnam to continue working on the mia pow issue . at 12 30 pm he will have lunch with the vice president in the oval office . and at 2 00 pm he will meet with the police organizations . then from 3 00 pm to 4 00 pm he will do his weekly photos with the various groups .  q a photo op with vessey ?  ms. myers there's no coverage on the vessey meeting .  q why ?  ms. myers why ? it's a closed meeting .  q what about the lunch ?  ms. myers the lunch ? no , there's no coverage .  q is he meeting with any congress people today ?  ms. myers nothing scheduled .  q there are no meetings  ms. myers there are no congressional meetings today , no.  q has the president been given any information by the pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from hanoi ? any instructions to vessey on how to deal with the vietnamese on that subject ?  ms. myers well , clearly , the report is the first order of business . it's high on the agenda on something that they will discuss . i think the president and general vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to vietnam today , but the president hasn not drawn any conclusions about the report yet . certainly , it's something that he wants general vessey to talk with the vietnamese about first  q did the president talk with any republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package ?  ms. myers he spoke with senator dole .  q how many times ?  ms. myers i believe once during the day and once last night .  q what was the outcome of that ?  ms. myers they are continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package .  q is it your impression that senator dole is in any way flexible on this ?  ms. myers well , i think we are hopeful that we are going to get some kind of jobs package through the senate , and we will continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement .  q did they discuss the vat tax ?  ms. myers i don not know if that came up .  q can you check that ?  ms. myers sure . q so what are they is the president offering to scale down his program is that what he's trying to do , buy it down to where dole will sign on ?  ms. myers well , he's trying to protect as much of it as he can . but it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the senate and through congress now . and as soon as we reach some conclusions on that , we will let you know . but at the moment , he's continuing to consult with members of congress including , obviously , senator dole .  q is he talking to anybody else ?  ms. myers i don not believe he talked to any other republicans yesterday .  q is he talking to anybody today ?  ms. myers i don not think anything is scheduled , but i wouldn not rule it out .  q we were led to believe that the president called mr. dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package . is that correct ?  ms. myers i think the president has contacted several people on russian aid . i think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole . the primary objective of the conversation was russian aid . that was the first order of business , but it was both .  q in the president's mind , are they linked politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the stimulus package , he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american people ? has he made that argument ?  ms. myers i can not talk about specifically what arguments he might have made . the president is obviously committed to both . he liked to see a jobs package to the american people first but as you know , we outlined the details of additional russian aid last night in tokyo .  q but does the president believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for russian to accept a vote for russian aid ?  ms. myers i think that the president is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package , to pass a jobs package , and we are still hopeful that we will get some kind of jobs package through the congress .  q is it fair to say that the president is negotiating now with dole ?  ms. myers he's discussing options with him .  q on the stimulus , is it your understanding that over the break some democrats , themselves , have left the support that they had earlier for the package , the stimulus package ?  ms. myers i think we still have wide support in the senate for the jobs package .  q but specifically , that you have lost democrats other than shelby ?  ms. myers i don not believe so . there hasn not been a vote .  q what about kohl ?  q kohl and feingold ?  ms. myers there hasn not been a vote yet . and we will continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote , because we believe that a majority of the members of the united states senate support the package .  q if you are weren not worried about kohl and feingold , why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day ?  ms. myers i think george pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded , or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn not pass .  q no democrats . laughter .  ms. myers i will let you draw your own conclusions .  q does he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republicans again today ?  ms. myers there's nothing specifically scheduled , but again , i wouldn not rule it out .  q does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today ?  ms. myers what we have done is we are in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state . i think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up , we will send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package .  q will you share those with us ?  ms. myers sure . as we did yesterday .  q do you have copies of the ones you sent  ms. myers yes , we made those available yesterday . and we certainly can continue to provide them today .  q dee dee , since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the vat , what further consideration of this issue has been given ?  ms. myers nothing's changed since yesterday . i think the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on , and i don not think we have anything to add to that .  q but he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it . can you tell us  ms. myers i think that there has been i m not going to speculate on who supports it . i think the president said that there has been some support among business and labor groups . i don not think he said he was directly contacted by them .  q are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this  ms. myers i think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently , but i don not think i want to add to that .  q in february , though , the president said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road . what has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind ?  ms. myers i think as we said yesterday , it is something that the working groups are looking at . they are considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the president's health care plan . the president has not taken it up yet , has not made a decision on it . and beyond that , i don not have anything to add .  q you haven not answered the question . it wasn not being considered by anyone in the white house after the president's comments in february , and george reaffirmed that in a briefing .  q and then suddenly  q what happened ? ms. myers the working groups , as we have said throughout , we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across the board and one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value added tax . q but the president himself took this off the table , dee dee , and suddenly it reappears . and this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way . what has happened in the meantime ? ms. myers the president has not looked at this , it hasn not been presented to him , again , yet . the working groups are looking at it , as they are looking at a wide variety of options , and no decisions have been made . q and it raises the question of how independently the task force is working . ms. myers the task force was instructed to consider all options , and they have taken that mandate seriously and they are considering all options . q but that's not the impression that the president left in february . the impression he left was that this was something that was long range , to be looked at 10 , 15 years down the road . the clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table , not an option . q if it changes i will tell you .  q bring him on . q and you repeatedly referred to the president's remarks , telling us that those were still in operation .  ms. myers it's changed , and we told you . laughter .  q but that's what alice rivlin's comments and donna shalala comments were about . i mean , that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers  ms. myers i wouldn not no , alice rivlin's not a cabinet member , first of all . second of all , it was not orchestrated , but clearly , they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked at . we confirmed that yesterday . and i don not have anything to add to that . q is it because he has very few options ? q is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about ? in other words , has the president himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table ? or is it , in fact , back on the table , having been placed there by discussions with the president ? ms. myers it is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the president of anything . it is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options . i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context , and at this point he's not that presentation has not been made , but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on . q they will present it to him as one of his options , though he specifically ruled it out ? ms. myers correct . q dee dee , is this more than a trial balloon ? is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation ? ms. myers it's simply a statement of fact . the working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform . one of the options that they are looking at is the vat . q dee dee , when the working groups were examining this possibility , was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not ? ms. myers i don not know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is . i don not know . q who was telling you that it was not under consideration ? ms. myers i was referring back to the president's comments . q have they discovered that the sin taxes won not raise enough money to fund the core benefit package ? ms. myers no , there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan .  q i m asking whether the projections  ms. myers there's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured . you can not decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like . and so you can not discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know . q dee dee , we have been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages . ms. myers correct . q the question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package . that is not a very difficult computation . ms. myers it is a question that you know that we are not going to answer until there's a number of options being considered . it depends on how the package is structured . the exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made .  q and when the president has been meeting with health care his health care advisors , which we are told he has been doing   ms. myers correct .  q they have never once said to him , these are your funding options , including the vat ? he has never heard the word vat in his  ms. myers i am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily they are not daily , but the quasi regular briefings .  q well , you have .  ms. myers i have not , other than to say that he's not considered the vat . and i think that is a true statement .  q no , but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option .  ms. myers correct .  q that doesn not mean he hasn not heard about it .  ms. myers i m not going to get into the details of what's discussed . i think that statement stands for itself .  q specific , dee dee . when you say he hasn not looked at it , do you mean that he hasn not looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage , or hasn not looked at it in general ? because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works , what the advantages are , the whole thing . it sounds like  ms. myers but that was i think in chilicothe , if you go back to his remarks there , it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure . and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan . but clearly , it's something that he's thought about in the broad context . i mean , that was clear in chilicothe . what i m saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn not considered yet . it's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options , and that no decisions have been made . and i m not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed .  q it's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place . you say that no option that the option has not been presented to him .  ms. myers that is correct .  q do you stand by does the white house still stand by george's statement in march that this will not be in the proposal ?  ms. myers no decisions have been made . we have nothing to add to what's already been said .  q let me follow up here . do you stand by what rivlin said yesterday , that if any kind of vat were to be used or considered , that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive ?  ms. myers i m not going to comment any further on what might happen if .  q but do you stand by the previous conversations in february that if there were to be a vat , i think the president said you would exclude food and energy  ms. myers i m not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn not been made .  q was the president aware prior to donna shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups ?  ms. myers i don not know specifically what  q could you check for us , because that's a real important credibility question ?  ms. myers sure .  q since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed , at the beginning and throughout , as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money . were you all kept in the dark ? was the press office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you have been denying that a vat tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option ?  ms. myers i think we have said all that we have to say . it is something the working groups are looking at . the president has not made a decision about it yet . and beyond that , i have nothing to add .  q well , sorry , dee dee , there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here yours primarily . what we are asking is , if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not , or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us .  ms. myers i don not believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium ever ever .  q has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something has anybody told anybody to come out  ms. myers we are not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody . i have said what i have to say about this issue .  q all we were trying to find out  ms. myers i understand what you are trying to find out and i have given you the answers , helen .  q we are trying to find out what changed what made it an option again . that's the  ms. myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options , and they are doing that .  q yes , but it wasn not an option before . how can you investigate it if the president has taken it off the table ?  ms. myers it is something that they are obviously considering and the president has not made a decision on .  q yes , but he took it off the table in february .  ms. myers working groups are considering it . they will present it to the president at some point and he will make a decision .  q why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table ?  ms. myers it's clearly on the table .  q yes , but he took it off the table . did he change his mind ?  ms. myers it's back on the table , bill .  q did he change his mind ?  ms. myers he said this morning that he hasn not made a decision about it . he obviously knows that it's on the table . it's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we will let you know .  q so he must have changed his mind , right ?  ms. myers at some point it will be looked at . i mean ,   q dee dee , there's like two options either he changed his mind or the working groups think they are authority exceeds the president's .  ms. myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options ; they have done that .  q are you going to put out his income tax ?  ms. myers yes , there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon . his return will be available .  q will there be any kind of briefing to go through it ?  ms. myers no , nothing's planned . i think someone will be available , probably not in a briefing setting , but to walk you through the questions .  q we are used to be walked line by line through the presidential tax forms.  ms. myers i have seen those briefings . laughter .  q could we have one ?  ms. myers no , i don not think there will be any kind of a formal briefing , but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it .  q did they file a joint form ?  ms. myers yes .  q when did he file it ?  ms. myers i believe it's being filed today .  q dee dee , is there going to be a backgrounder for miyazawa ?  ms. myers no , there will be a readout after the meeting .  q no backgrounder today ?  ms. myers no backgrounder today .  q this is complicated stuff . we need help . laughter .  ms. myers we can not give you taxes and miyazawa all in one day , it's too confusing . laughter .  q vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of force in bosnia . they have both said that , a , they never ruled it out , and b , it might be necessary now . does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach ?  ms. myers there's been no change in our policy towards bosnia . we have always said that we would consider  q but does that impact upon your decision ? are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you ?  ms. myers they are people whose opinions carry weight certainly . i mean , the president supports the process that they have initiated . but there's been no change in our policy for bosnia , although we are considering a number of options right now . if the serbs don not come back to the negotiating table , if they don not sign on to some kind of an agreement , we will consider additional options , which we have been saying regularly .  q one follow up question then ? we cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration . why do you not set a deadline for the serbs ? can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table ?  ms. myers we are continuing to put pressure on them every day .  q which doesn not work so  ms. myers well , we think it is having some effect . we are going to continue to tighten sanctions . as you know , we support the omnibus resolution . we expect that to come to a vote on the 26th .  q you say it's having an effect can you give us any documentation ?  ms. myers i would be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that .  q there's been no you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in bosnia . serbia , yes ; in bosnia , no.  ms. myers i think that they have had effect in serbia and we think they have had some effect in bosnia . and again , i will be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that , if you would like .  q we would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in bosnia . we had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in belgrade , but we haven not seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting . can you  ms. myers i will see what i can get you .  q on the extra russian aid that christopher announced this morning where is that money coming from ?  ms. myers we will have to work with congress on the details of that package .  q so that would be new money that you would hope to get ?  ms. myers yes , that's new money , in addition to the $ 1 . 6 billion announced in vancouver . so i assume that you all have seen the $ 1 . 8 billion package that was announced this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher .  q isn not there a concern , though , about offering something which you have to get in congress ? i mean , that was the concern with vancouver ; you didn not want to do that .  ms. myers the concern with vancouver was to do something immediately , which required money that was already approved in the fiscal 93 budget . what we are looking at now is a little bit longer term plan to build on top of the $ 1 . 6 billion that we announced in vancouver . this clearly will require congressional approval , or some of it will anyway , and we are going to continue to work with congress to make that happen .  q to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by congress ?  ms. myers the president has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward  q was christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through congress ?  ms. myers it was created in consultation with congress .  q in meeting with the law enforcement officials , is that does that have a set speech and a goal ? a direction ?  ms. myers yes , the president will talk about and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the president's jobs package . they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do .  q who are they ?  ms. myers it's members or leadership from three organizations napo , which is the national association of police organizations ; ibpo , which is the international brotherhood of police organizations , i believe ; and iupa , which is the international union of police associations .  q will the fbi chief be there ?  ms. myers the fbi chief ? no.  q or any other federal law enforcement officials ?  ms. myers no , it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leaders .  q does the $ 1 . 8 billion announced today include the $ 400 million that's in the fy 94 budget for disarmament ?  ms. myers no. the nunn lugar money is separate .  q so this would be the $ 700 million that's in the budget already , plus another $ 1 . 1 billion ?  ms. myers i believe all of this is on top of the $ 700 million already in the budget .  q is this going to be part of the supplemental or fiscal 94  ms. myers we will work with congress on the exact funding mechanism on exactly how this will be paid for .  q this $ 1 . 8 billion on top of  ms. myers on top of $ 700 million on top of the $ 400 million nunn lugar money we announced earlier .  q and this is what prompted the president to call bob dole it was on this tranche , not on the previous money he was calling bob dole ?  ms. myers correct .  q is there a briefing on miyazawa ?  ms. myers there will be a readout after the meeting with miyazawa . tomorrow .  q dee dee , on a totally unrelated matter , some republicans who are active in the u.s. chamber of commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house and the chamber of commerce . there are the town hall meeting the other night , the satellite and all of this relationship . does the white house feel that you are getting too close to these chambers of commerce ?  ms. myers that's an interesting charge . laughter . after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the chambers , now there are those who would accuse us of being too close . i think that's interesting . but no , we are thrilled by the support we have received from the national chamber and local chambers across the country and we will continue to work with them on this and other initiatives .  q what's the status of the president thinking about going to this democratic retreat ?  ms. myers it's on his calendar . i think he will almost certainly go .  q all three days ?  ms. myers we haven not figured out exactly when he will be there yet .  q is it open to coverage ?  ms. myers no , i believe the whole thing is closed .  q is he going to have any kind of address , statement , anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th ?  ms. myers we are still looking at that . we haven not made a final decision about how we will who will make a statement or what  q any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders ?  ms. myers nothing is scheduled , but i wouldn not rule it out .  q what about an aids czar ?  ms. myers it's coming .  q anything on the weekend ?  q there's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march .  ms. myers no , i think this is something he's been discussing for a long time appearing at the senate democratic retreat .  q the weekend ?  ms. myers weekend ? don not know the only thing on right now is the radio address on saturday .  q any travel plans ?  ms. myers if it changes none right now .  q he's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package ?  ms. myers no specific plans right now .  q what about mid week ? anything likely ?  ms. myers it's possible . yes , i think it's likely that we will travel next week certainly the weekend .  q has he called thurmond about his daughter ?  ms. myers i don not know . i will check .  q going to name a drug czar this weekend ?  ms. myers this weekend ? i don not believe so .  q and the radio address on saturday is that going to be focused on the stimulus package ?  ms. myers i m sure it will .  the press thank you . end10 10 am edt
1			windows	server			 blinking cursor in xterm ? as quoted from by bernward averwald  back in the days of x11 . 1 i did analyse the xterm code . the cursor was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character . i doesn not seem to be changed not il now . but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via xtappaddtimeout or similar . the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous , though see also desqview x , which does this in its dos windows . do you really want xterm to wake up every half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt ? so what ? i m running emu on a 25 mhz 68020 box . i cannot make out any difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or not if you think about it a bit , a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of time for even the slowest pc . since you would of course only enable the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus , this application is active anyway . to repeat it , a blinking text cursor costs almost nothing in performance , it just needs some thought when designing the xterm software . michael  michael elbel , digital pcs gmbh , muenchen , germany intelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer doofe mia fermentation fault coors dumped

3			peter	bike			 solvent for duct tape adhesive ? i know this is a long shot , but does anyone know what solvent i should use to clean duct tape adhesive from carpet ? yet another suggestion , but this one is non toxic although i would handle it like any other cleaner and it smells nice . the chemical is called d limonene , and it smells like lemon peels i think it is a lemon extract of some kind . you might find it in a hardware store , sold as a general purpose solvent , but your best bet would be any bike store it is used as a chain cleaning fluid . it works on sticker glue , crayons , grease , oil , etc. it's clear yellow in the bottle , and you can use it straight ; if you add water , it changes to a creamy consistency , which is good for some jobs . peter

1			routine			 fractals ? what good are they ? they talked about another routine that could yield up to 150 to 1 compress with no image loss that i could notice . the draw back is that it takes a hell of a long time to compress something . i will have to see if i can find the book so that i can give more exact numbers . ttyl . that's a typical claim , though they say they have improved compression speed considerably . did you find out anything else about the book ? i would be interested in looking at it if you could give me any pointers . reportedly , early fractal compression times of 24 100 hours used that marvelous piece of hardware called grad students to do the work . supposedly it's been automated since about 1988 , but i m still waiting to be impressed . allen b sign me cynical
5			tradition	doctrine	camp	representative	church			 monophysites and mike walker comments chalcedon was a compromise between two groups , the alexandrians and antiochenes . it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps , while ruling out the extremes . i agree that there were extremes that were heretical . however in the course of the complex politics of the time , it appears that some people got rejected who didn not intend heresy , but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented . and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine . there are  groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps . this  posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians . there are also a remaining nestorians . like some of the current so called monophysites , there is reason to believe that the current so called nestorians are not heretical either . they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment , but claim they did not adopt his heresies , and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition .  clh there is a big difference between the status of what you refer to as alexandrians actually , this includes all oriental orthodox churches and not only copts and that of nestorians . the oriental orthodox churches never even shelter eutyches the advocator of monophysitism but on the contrary , it condemned and still does condemn him and his heresy . that is why the eastren chalcedonian orthodox church held talks with the oriental non chalcedonian that started 30 years ago and still continueing till today , but they have converged on many issues the most imporatant of which is christology i have more details of the inter orthodox dialogue , in case anyone is interested . so i do not see how the alexandrians and the nestorians are in a similar position . peace , nabil . nabil ayoub engine research center dept . of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin madison email

1			condition	procedure	setup	space	pixel	graphics	manufacturer			 colour transform for red green colour blindness posted on behalf of craig southeren who does not have access to a net account  can anyone provide me with a colour space transform that would emulate the effects of red green colour blindness ? i have had a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results . perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help ?  certainly . reference follows . bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red green colour blind . one , protanopia , is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the l cones , those that respond best to long wavelengths . this gives much reduced red green and red violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision . the other , deuteranopia , is due to missing or dysfunctional m cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the l m cone difference signals in the retina . it also gives reduced red green discrimination but red violet is unaffected . unlike protanopia , reds are not dimmer than normal . on a uniform chromaticity diagram the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books there is a single confusion point for each type of colour point . for protanopia the point is at u 0 . 61 , v 0 . 51 , very close to the far red corner . for deuteranopia , the point is at u 4 . 75 , v 1 . 31 note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup , random errors , and so on . the values quoted are typical . so if all colours on a line are seen as the same , which colour is actually seen ? this problem has now been solved . tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse . for protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus the edge of the horseshoe ; for deuteranopes the line is very similar , joining 477nm and 579nm . so to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia 1 plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2 construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3 find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4 this is the new chromaticity . the best reference for this is meyer , g . w . & greenberg , d . p . 1988 colour defective vision and computer graphics displays , ieee computer graphics and applications 8 5 28 40 . you will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the cie xyz colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram . i would like to write a program probably a ppm filter to allow previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour blind users . not being colour blind myself , this is a bit difficult ! yes this is certainly possible . you will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on , and the chromaticity of the white point . this information can be measured , or obtained from the manufacturer . i posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago . the procedure , for each pixel ! is as follows . some lookup tables might be a help here . a convert rgb to cie xyz . this is a simple 3 3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data . b retaining the y component for later , convert xyz to chromaticity coordinates u v using u 4x x 15y 3z , v 9y x 15y 3z c find the equation of the line as in step 2 above d find the intersection as in step 3 e convert back from u v to xyz , using the y value from step a f ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor ; if not , move it along a line in xyz space towards neutral grey ie half way between black and white until it is displayable . please email replies i will summarise and repost if there is sufficient interest done ; also posted for the rest of us .  chris lilley  technical author , itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit , manchester computing centre , oxford road , manchester , uk . m13 9pl internet voice 44 0 61 275 6045 fax 44 0 61 275 6040 janet

4						 supply side revenue  the result is that clinton now hopes to reduce the deficit to a level above where it was when reagan left office . which , considering the amount bush&congress added to it , would be a not inconsiderable achievement . while we are on the subject , i also believe that the supply side claim that reducing taxes raised revenue is also false , because they typically factor in socsec taxes , which were raised a considerable amount , at the same time that income taxes were cut . if you look at income tax revenue alone , it fell after after the cuts began , and didn not recover for several years . by then , record deficits were well entrenched .  chew on that awhile . crunch , crunch steve soar
3			apple	logic	chip	mac			 what to do with old 256k simms ? how hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular motorola microcontrollers . i am a novice at microcontrollers , but i am starting to get into them for some of my projects . i have several 256k simms laying around from upgraded macs and if i could use them as free memory in one or two of my projects that would be great . one project that comes to mind is a caller id device that would require quite a bit of ram to store several hundered cid records etc . assuming 68hc11 . in expanded muxed mode , you could do it . much easier if you get a dram controller ic . the mmi 673102 could be used to implement this , or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row column refresh address multiplexing . the thing with drams is that they require wierd timing , address multiplexing , and refresh . actually , if you wanted to use a 68008 ic , you could look at an897 , which has a neat controller built in . there is also the 683xx , i think one of those has the dram controller built in . this one is for the 6664 dram , however , the 41256 has only one more address line , adding only another component or so . the 256k simms are basically 8 or 9 41256 dram chips or their equivalent in fewer packages . it can be done , just takes a bit of logic design . i m actually about to do it using a 65c02p3 chip . i have got 8 256k simms . that's 2 megabytes on my apple e . used to be in my 386 .

5			church	country	christian	christ	massacre	god	bosnia	bible	war			 doing the work of god ? as our local . religion . christian bbs group seems moribund , i m posting here . on one of the sundays just before easter i went to church . the sermon was based on a story in the book of joshua . the one about joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take what i particularly remember , because of having heard part of a cbc radio documentary on bosnia , was that the rahab the woman who sheltered the spies said that the people were melting in fear . what with having heard that cbc radio documentary and knowing that the muslims in bosnia were losing the war , i felt uncomfortable . after all , the serbs are driving non christians out . on the other hand , ministers do say that the bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society . anyhow members of that church are involved in out of country missionary work . also , the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing christ to the nonreligious people of our area . the next sunday , the sermon was about joshua 6 where the israelites take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there except for rahab , who had sheltered the spies . with those reports about bosnia in my mind , i felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre the one in joshua was right . but what really bothered me was that , if i was going to try taking christianity seriously , i shouldn not be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in bosnia . certainly , my sympathies shouldn not be with the moslims. considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians who , under turkish rule , converted to islam could the serbs be doing god's work ? the example of god's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest has always been troubling in discussions here . i personally question whether they were right even at the time . but those who believe they were consider that the wars were justified only because they were specifically commanded by god . somehow i don not see the serbs behaving like a group that is led by god in this matter . clh
3			satellite	war	space	propulsion	shuttle	defense	nasa	management	technology			 end of the space age there is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's la times thursday april 15 , 1993 , p . d1 . i thought i would post it to stir up some flame wars i mean reasoned debate . let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the space age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over , and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time . reading , for example , what's new the weekly physics update we get here on the net it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine grained manipulation of matter by which i include biotechnology , condensed matter physics with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere , and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days . to a large extent , i think , the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia . i feel sure that someday we or more precisely , our mind children will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out ; but i think that manned space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do now . anyway , let me quote some of this article , but not all . space age glory fades from view micheal schrage writer , consultant , and research associate at mit at 35 , america's space age won not have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis . the reason is that the space age is already dead . the technologies no longer define our times , and the public has grown weary of the multibillion dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards . space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue . speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate , our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy . to be sure , america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing cheap deep space probes would be nice too but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead . . before the change in administrations , it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age . the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $ 30 billion to build space station freedom alone . even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains , office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditures . the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much . political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibilities determined multibillion dollar space budgets . indeed , with few notable exceptions , such as voyager , the post apollo era is the story of the gold plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more . . while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration , it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america's technological prowess . the space station budget has rightly been slashed . space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda . . i wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen now , says bruce murray , a caltech professor who ran nasa's jet propulsion lab in pasadena . we have put off a lot of things we shouldn not have . i would rather see a $ 10 billion nasa doing well than a $ 40 billion one filled with white elephants .
5			resurrection	soul	notion	mary	god	heaven	revelation	writing	grace	belief			 question about virgin mary as the moderator noted , i think you mean the assumption . catholics believe that the blessed virgin mary went to heaven body and soul at the end of her life . this is unusual because the normal course of events is for your body to decay in the grave and stay that way until the resurrection of the dead . well , it wasn not that way for enoch and elijah , both of whom were translated directly into heaven . it's beyond my grasp why some object that mary , who was far greater than either enoch or elijah , should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved . she was after all , mother of god , full of grace , and immaculate . historically , belief in the assumption can be found in the writings of st gregory of tours late 6th century . and in st germain of constantinople and st john of damascus , and in st andrew of crete , among others . and it should be noted that the monophysite chruches of egypt and syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation , even though they broke away from the unity of the chruch in 451 ad by rejecting the council of chalcedon . it might be argued by some protestants that the catholics and orthodox made this belief up , but the monophysites , put a big hole in that notion , as they also hold the belief , and they split from the chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing as far as is known , much has been lost from the time of the fathers . andy byler

3			kidney	industry	gospel	medicine	newspaper			 kidney stones x gated by usenet rosemail gateway v1 . 70 . b medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way . there b has always been the use of conventional wisdom . a very good example is b kidney stones . conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been b done to come up with an effective prevention , was that restricitng the b intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones b from forming . clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to b breakdown the stone once it formed . through the recent new england j of b medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong , b increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is b restricting calcium intake . . b marty b . marty , i personally wouldn not be so quick and take that nejm article on kidney stones as gospel . first of all , i would want to know who sponsored that study . i have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from local newspapers , magazines , to tv guide , with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the dairy industries . there are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake . secondly , were all the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition ? the study didn not say that , it only claimed that most kidney stones are large ly calcium . perhaps it won not be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings . a curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong . it wouldn not be the first time .  sodium magnesium calcium phosphorus ratios are , in my opinion , still the most reliable indicators for the cause , treatment , and prevention of kidney stones . i , for one , will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type ; and they definitely won not include an increase in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a phosphorus raising approach instead ! ron roth  internet rosenet ron roth rosehamilton a stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body .  rosereader 2 . 10 p003228 entered at rosehamilton rosemail 2 . 10 usenet rose media hamilton 416 575 5363

4			tradition	roman	series	morris	belief	waco	inning			 cults , waco & insanity originator rja mahogany126  i ask this question because there is a tradition , and one that is highly regarded by many people , that several hundred jews elected to throw themselves off a cliff at masada rather than submit to roman rule . the circumstances at masada and those at waco would seem in general terms quite similar , and yet so far as i m aware nobody has seriously suggested that the jews were insane .  as has already been pointed out , the jews faced a totally different fate at the hand of the romans than did koresh at the hand of the feds . the jewish men would most likely have been crucified , the the women and children sold into slavery . one can well argue that koresh may have thought that a similar fate awaited him , but there was scant rational basis for that fear , so insane seems to describe any such belief . what is the penalty if convicted of murdering 4 federal agents in texas ? the death penalty . none of which excuses the reckless action of the feds , who allegedly believing they were dealing with a nut , should have exercise much more restraint . indeed , given their stated goals of saving the children , one might also apply the moniker insane to the feds actions . yup .  russ anderson disclaimer any statements are my own and do not reflect upon my employer or anyone else . c 1993 ex twins jack morris , 10 innings pitched , 0 runs world series mvp !

1			understanding	graphics	team	sgi	communication	bus	sale	technology	nasa	series	price	writing	perspective	nature	representative	management	customer	mountain	announcement			 sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement ? my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl , rather than deal further with sgi . opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great , portable interface for the development of interactive 3d graphics applications . it is not , however , an indicator of performance , as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor . sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools , so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms , there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable .  what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck . if your sales representative truly mislead you , then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team . feel free to contact the local branch manager . we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers , so give it a shot .  i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while , rather than being flushed . as one of the previous posts stated , the personal iris was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4d 20 , 4d 25 , 4d 30 and 4d 35 as clock rates sped up over time . as a rule of thumb , sgi platforms live for about 4 5 years . this was true of the motorola based 3000 series 85 89 , the pi 88 93 , the professional series the early 4d's 86 90 , the power series parallel systems 88 93 . individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years . new graphics architectures at the high end gt , vgx , realityengine are released every 18 months to 2 years . these are the facts of life . if we look at these machines , they become almost archaic after four years , and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo , onyx , challenge which has higher bus bandwidths , faster cpus , faster graphics and i o , and larger disk capacities . if we don not , we become uncompetitive . from the user perspective , you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today . you can not wait to buy , but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine , ask the sales rep for one in writing . if it's feasible , they should be able to do that . some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them , such as the performance protection program for older r3000 based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r4400 based 64 bit multiprocessor systems.  now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter , but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process .  if that's happening , it's becausing of misunderstandings or mis communication , not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base . maybe it's because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies , so we aren not entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa , for instance are . this lab , and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations , doesn not have a load of money to spend on computers every year , so we can not be out buying new systems on a regular basis . most sgi customers are onesy twosey types , but regardless , we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again , like a previous post stated , if we pre announced and the schedule slipped , we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments . the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond . that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one previous poster's words , not o fill a niche to compete with some other vendor . i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years . and every time i look at it , i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money , since we are supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars .  five years is an awfully long time in computer years . new processor technologies are arriving every 1 2 years , making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times . the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development , so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases , you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor . there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with , but keeping customers happy is the most important , so don not give up , we know it . josh    joshua mogal product manager advanced graphics division advanced graphics systems silicon graphics

5			fire	suicide	conversation	compound	state	client	mormon	setting			 who's next ? mormons and jews ? the fbi claims , on the basis of their intelligence reports , that bd's had no plans to commit suecide . they , btw , had bugged the place and were listening to bd's conversations till the very end .  koresh's attorney claims that , based on some 30 hours he spent talking to his client and others in the compound , he saw no indication that bd's were contemplating suecide .  the survivors claim it was not a suecide .  it's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim . it is clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that bd members had started the fire . no , this is far from clear . we only have the word of the fbi spokepeople that a survivor made this claim . we have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that all of them agreed that they did not have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire . in the absense of any more evidence , i don not see how we can decide who to believe . furthermore , its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else . with the state of the area now , we may never know what happened .  bd's were not contemplating suecide , and there is no reason to believe they committed one .  no reason ? how about these two  1 . some of the survivors claimed that bd members poured fuel along the corridors and set fire to it . the speed at which the fire spread is not inconsistent with this claim . again , we have only the word of the fbi on this claim . the lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim .  2 . there was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound . there is a very very good possibility that the fbi did not start this fire . this is a good reason to believe that the bd's did . i will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities . its more likely that the bd's started the fire than did the fbi . but there is currently no way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence which is nearly none .  3 . even if the bd's were not contemplating suicide , it is very possible that david koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this was not suicide . it was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort .  there are three possibilities other than the bd's self destruction  a . they are not dead , but escaped via bunker , etc. from reports of the inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found , i would rate this as highly unlikely .  b . the fire was started by an fbi accident . this is possible , but it would be foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it . sure , it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of the day near the edge of the complex ? it's anecdotal evidence that has been contradicted by other escapees .  c . the fire was started on purpose by the fbi . this has been suggested by some on the net , and i would rate this possibility as utterly ludicrous . this is what we in sci . skeptic would call an extraordinary claim and won not bother refuting unless someone gives any good evidence to back it up . d . the fire was an started accidentally by the bds . i am truely amazed that i have heard or read of no one suggesting this possibility . with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks , it had to have been chaotic inside . i can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over . with the winds , it would have quickly gotten out of control .  so we are left with two reasonable possibilities . that the fire was an fbi accident and that the fire was started by the bd . i find the latter more likely based on the evidence i have seen so far . no , i think that d is also quite reasonable . i personally can not really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue , i would probably take an accident either fbi or bd over intential setting of the fire . i would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds . the coroner was on the today show this morning and categorically denied that they have reach any such conclusions . he pointed out that under intense heat , sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports i have read and heard in short , there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on monday . we should remain skeptical until more information is available .  isaac kuo o twinkle , twinkle , little . sig ,  bob garwood

5			sale	atheist	weapon	war	nature	satellite	technology	technique	troop	right			 gulf war was re death penalty was re political atheists ? . details of us built chemical plant at al alteer near baghdad . however , the plant's intended use was to aid the iraqi infrastructure . it is not an example of selling a weapon . may sound nitpicking , but are we going to refuse to sell valuable parts that build the infrastructure because of dual use technology ? i am contending that in this case and in the case of the sale of pesticides by uk companies that they knew full well that it was to be used for the production of chemical weapons even if that was not its officially stated purpose . i personally don not think that letting iran conquer iraq would have been a good thing . for that matter , neither do i for the reasons you state . it is the hypocrisy and claims the us did not help iraq that make me angry , plus the fact that the usa seems to believe it has the right to interfere where is sees fit i.e. has an interest rather than a duty to intervene where it is required . this is demonstrated by the failure of the us to do anything about east timor and the region is becoming destabilised . the usa might have done something approaching the right thing , given my reservations about the uncessary number of civillian casualites , but for wholly the wrong reasons and after having a hand in creating the situation . that in no way would affect the us later military action against iraq . i did not suggest it would and it would be ridiculous to assert otherwise . i was simply indicating the usa has previously aided iraq . intel on manufacturing techniques , or something of that nature ? no , apparently data orginally from satellites although i doubt that iraq would have been given the raw data concerning troop concentrations . aaron turner
3			chip			 motorola xc68882rc33 and rc50 . i don not know why my fpu has an xc my original 33mhz fpu was label mc68882 33 , but it seems to work fine on my system . ps or does it mean experimental chip instead of motorola chip ?  the rule for the designations is that if it says mc , that means it works exactly the way the datasheet book specifies . if it says xc , that means there is at least one known bug . often these bugs are small and obscure ; you might never run into them in practice .  xc units are often pre production sample devices . those are normally distributed for evaluation as freebies and are not guaranteed to meet every spec . at least motorola admits it , unlike certain other companies . yep , that's for sure . that's one thing i like most about motorola . aaron

5			waco	christianity	god	reasoning	belief	christian	meaning	logic			 christian's need for christianity was . for example why does the universe exist at all ? whether there is a why or not we have to find it . this is pascal's ? wager . if there is no why and we spend our lives searching , then we have merely wasted our lives , which were meaningless anyway . if there is a why and we . suppose the universe is 5 billion years old , and suppose it lasts another 5 billion years . suppose i live to be 100 . that is nothing , that is so small that it is scary . so by searching for the why along with my friends here on earth if nothing else we aren not so scared . i find this view of christianity to be quite disheartening and sad . the idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a creator does not seem like much of a basis for belief . and the logic is also appalling god must exist because i want him to . i have heard this line of reasoning before and wonder how prevalent it is . certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is hopeless or so the pollsters and newscasts state , but i don not see where this is a good reason to become religious . if you want meaning why not just join a cult , such as in waco ? the leaders will give you the security blanket you desire . larry henling

3						 lead acid batteries & concrete ? the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate . that's why the old wives tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery thermally . it you will set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam , it will self discharge even slower . there are a number of inaccuracies here 1 in fact , a colder battery will self discharge more slowly . this is why batteries should be stored in a cool , dry place . 2 an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed on wood . the battery , the wood , and the concrete will all be at the same general temperature ignoring temperature fluctuations and thus none will effect the other . the best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly , but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow cycle the charge in the battery . such mild exercising of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage . there is no need to exercise the battery . just keep it charged . a trickle charger will do the job . stuff deleted

5			technique	content	german	mormon	jesus	figure	writing			 ancient books i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described . this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time . hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass , hermeneutrik und kritik , einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen , vol 1 of handbuch der klassischen altertums wissenshaft noerdlingen beck , 1886 . portions of this are described in nibley , the prophetic book op mormon , pp 219 242 slc deseret book , 1989 . if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned . nibley describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject , then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader . nibley's extract from blass's work is in the form of rules for forgers . it makes interesting reading . i confess that i have not read blass's work , only nibley's extract thereof . my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as i know there is no english translation available . however , i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame . we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery . actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents 1 . alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof . for example the dead sea scrolls . these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper , inks , and objects found with them . this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects . 2 . documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent . for example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists . this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple . we cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself . it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be . they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin . for example i have heard of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king in what is now iraq . if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph . they could check the language , content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a palestinian jew of that time . however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it . we would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there . there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was . as i say , i m no expert on blas's work . i do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works . specifically we might ask 1 . is the document internally consistent ? does it contradict itself ? if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency , even if it is a forgery . the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency . for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents . 2 . is it consistent with the history and geography of the time ? again a short , non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection . here we look for the minor , inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check . the devil is in the details . 3 . what about the literary style of the work , figures of speech etc. any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us . are there any such odd phrases in this book ? if so do they fit in with the culture ? of course there are complications if the document has been translated , or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it . a few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies . they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don not necessarily prove forgery . these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy . they require the skills of the historian , the linguist , the anthropologist etc. the questions to ask are , is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin ? if there are things which don not fit how significant are they ? are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge , later changes by copists or are they really significant ? there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture . the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies . however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions . this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials . it is , however , the real world and what scholarship has to offer .
5			contradiction	state	satan	angel	conversation	truth	concept	gospel	god			 gospel dating  wild and fanciful claims require greater evidence . if you state that one of the books in your room is blue , i certainly do not need as much evidence to believe than if you were to claim that there is a two headed leapard in your bed . and i don not mean a male lover in a leotard !  keith ,  if the issue is , what is truth then the consequences of whatever proposition argued is irrelevent . if the issue is , what are the consequences if such and such is true , then truth is irrelevent . which is it to be ? i disagree every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support , before one can believe it . there are a miriad of factors for each individual . as we are all different , we quite obviously require different levels of evidence . as one pointed out , one's history is important . while in fussr , one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans . one would need more evidence , than if one lived in the united states . the only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the us , is if the individual always wear business suits , etc. the degree of the effect upon the world , and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary . when determining the level of evidence one needs , it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are . if the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent , please explain why one would not accept the electro magnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart . remember , if the consequences of the law are not relevent , then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof . if one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs , or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law , they are irrelevent when theorizing about the truth of the law . given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent , including the consequence of self contradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars , how are we ever able to judge what is true or not ; let alone find the truth ? by the way , what is truth ? please define before inserting it in the conversation . please explain what truth or truth is . i do think that anything is ever known for certain . even if there is a truth , we could never possibly know if it were . i find the concept to be meaningless .  satan and the angels do not have freewill . they do what god tells them to do . s . n . mozumder

3			space	escrow	proposal	chip	nsa	police			 is key escrow enough ? the points raised about checking what is actually in the chip , as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein , raise yet another trust issue . even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering a wide range of s1 and s2 seeds rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits , i assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data . they would presumably be punching numbers into a computer , which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the s1 and s2 values they are feeding into the system . s1 and s2 are clearly the backdoor we should assume they are all compromised . if they are not compromisable , why the hell not use a hardware true random number source . there isn not a random number source anywhere in this proposal . the whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip . nope , it can not be trusted . this is all about two levels of access the possibly honest key escrow that police forces have to use , and ostensibly the fbi ; and the back door that lets the nsa decode everything on the fly and maybe some back handers to the fbi when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours . g

1			chip	mac	ibm	electronics			 ide vs scsi dave write are we talking about a scsi 1 device e.g. hd on a scsi 2 controller or are we talking about a scsi 1 controller that had a chip upgrade using the same chip that is on a scsi 2 controller board we are talking about a scsi 1 device e.g. hd on a scsi 2 controller . here is a rewrite of my mac & info sheet scsi section scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm . allows the use of any device hard drive , printer , scanner , nubus card expansion mac plus only , some monitors , and cd rom . normal asynchronous scsi is 5 mhz ; fast synchronous scsi is 10 mhz . difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers . main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and end . any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm . scsi 1 8 bit ; 7 devices per scsi controller . asynchronous 1 . 5mb s ave and synchronous 5mb s max transfers . 8 bit scsi 2 is often mistaken for a fast version of scsi 1 see scsi 2 for details . scsi 2 fully scsi 1 compliant . scsi 2 mode 10 devices per scsi controller . 8 bit scsi 2 is implimented as a very fast scsi 1 since it can run using scsi 1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices , which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of scsi 1 . 16 bit and 32 bit scsi 2 require different ports , electronics , and scsi software drivers from scsi 1 which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces . 32 bit scsi seems to run only in synchronous mode , hence term wide and fast scsi transfer speeds are 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit , 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit , and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst 32 bit . 8 bit scsi 2 is the biggest headache due to the fact that it is the only scsi 2 that i know of that can pump scsi 2 speeds through scsi 1 devices and software controlers . its main implimentation is on the mac though you do see adds for scsi 2 at 10mb s maximum throughput for pcs . since 8 bit scsi 2 does not need all the hardware including electonics and software of 16 bit and 32 bit scsi 2 it is the cheepest of the scsi 2 interfaces . just pop out the scsi 1 electornics and pop in 8 bit scsi 2 electronics . some people consider 16 bit where scsi 2 really starts i used to be one of them but 4 6mb s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10mb s is not scsi 1 but is 8 bit scsi 2 . rule of thumb if it is scsin and over 5mb s then it is some type of scsi 2 . 8 bit scsi can use part of scsi 1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32 bit scsi 2 .

5			notion	truth	god	atheist	morality			 political atheists ? i think that you are confusing the words objective and inherent . and objective system is simply one in which an outside observer who , given the postulates of the system , could perfectly judge any situation or action as consistent with the system right or not wrong . you seem to be objecting because the goals of the system are not inherent . that is , you seem to want to define an objective system as one in which the postulates themselves could be determined by some outside observer . i don not think that this is a good definition of an objective system . then you need to learn english . really ? gravity is an objective system . anybody can learn what it is , and perform experiments . they will get the same results as every other person who has performed those experiments . no , gravity is an inherent system . you don not need any excess information other than observations to determine anything . it is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non inherent system . i agree that morality is not necessarily inherent unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis , but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory . this natural morality is not an objective system , as evidenced by your comments about lions , and mine . perhaps it can be objective , but not inherent . anyway , as i noted before , the practices related to mating rituals , etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law . therefore , some revisions are in order , since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems. and in fact , the only way that the postulates could be determined by an outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth , like some sort of god or something . but , i do not think that a god is necessary for an objective system , while it seems that you do . what are you trying to say here ? it seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence , which would necessitate some sort of grand design ? no , i have classified behavior of most animals as in line with a moral system . it is certainly possible for animals to commit acts which are outside of their rules of ethics , but they don not seem to do so very often . perhaps they are not intelligent enough to be immoral . and perhaps it's because you have yet to define a moral system . i think i have . it is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors , etc. an immoral behavior could be unwanted , unproductive , or destructive , etc . depending on the goal of the system that is , immoral to what end ? keith

5			mr.	christian	truth	interpretation	arrogance	christianity	god	scripture			 the arrogance of christians i just thought i would share some words that i received in a letter from moody bible institute a couple of months ago . the words are by james m . stowell , the president of mbi .  the other day , i was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing . it caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing evangelical christians , saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are .  he missed the point . no , imo , mr. stowell missed the point . we affirm the absolutes of scripture , not because we are arrogant moralists , but because we believe in god who is truth , who has revealed his truth in his word , and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes . mr. stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes . i don not see how that necessarily follows . are all truths also absolutes ? is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes ? if the answer to either of these questions is no , then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths , and which truths are absolutes . and , who is qualified to make these determinations ? there is hardly consensus , even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation . i find mr. stowell's statement terribly simple minded . carol alvin

4			fire	murder	waco	understanding	firearm	truth	batf	compound	technique	violation	abuse	prophecy	christ	crime			 batf fbi murders almost everyone in waco today ! 4 19  according to an australian documentary made in the year before the stand off began , koresh and his followers all believed he was christ koresh had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound . these were the perfect children resulting from the great seed of his magnified horn . ex members describe him in ways not dissimilar to the way jim jones has been described .  i don not know how accurate the documentary was ; the documentary interviewed koresh and current and ex members . the documentary disucussed koresh's christ status inside the cult , cult brain washing techniques , and unusual sex practices the leader gets any he wants , and tells others when they can or can not . i will let others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is technically child abuse or not . however , koresh was never convicted of any crimes against children , nor was the batf after him for child abuse . their purview in this case is strictly in firearms violations , all true . so this information is irrelevant to the discussion . well , if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult , then the history and background of the cult is very relevant . the history and backgournd of the jones cult was very important in understanding what happened at jonestown . not taking into account the history and background of koresh's cult may also help explain why the fbi and batf so badly predicted the reponses they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in this badly handled affair . fbi agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background checks . plus , those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain their decisions in great detail to congress . why would the fbi want to fulfill koresh's own prophecy ?  those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain something , but whether their answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know . and who is left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled ? it only holds meaning for the nine who survived . it is likely that there will be at least two investigations jd and congress at this point . correction the fbi said that two of the cult members said this ; so far , no one else has been able to talk to them .  so , when they talk to the news reporters directly , and relate the same details , will you believe them ?  if they confirm the story , i probably will . definitely not until then , however . interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out . i have reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast  mike ruff
2			pitching	baseball	game	defense	team	run			 braves pitching updatedir  one of the chapters in palmer and thorn's hidden game is titled pitching is 44 of baseball , implying that fielding is 6 . how do they determine that ? beats me it's been a long , long time since i read it . this was my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game . the argument was 1 defense , or runs allowed , is 50 of the game . 2 unearned runs amount to 12 of the runs allowed ; earned runs , 88 . 3 since unearned runs are the result of fielding , not pitching , and earned runs are the product of pitching , not fielding , fielding is 12 of defense and pitching is 88 of defense . 4 caombining with 1 , pitching is 44 of the game , fielding 6 . pete is usually sharper than that . my own feel is that fielding is in the 25 33 of defense range ; call it 30 70 between fielding and pitching . one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning , with the split probably somewhere around 49 . 5 and 0 . 5 . i would give baserunning a little more credit than that , maybe 45 5 , or even 40 10 . give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which wouldn not be that unreasonable , and even if you don not let roberto steal a single base , they will score a lot more than the oleruds by going first to third more often . no offense , gordon . clay d .
3			symptom	infection	patient	yeast	candida	vitamin			 candida yeast bloom , fact or fiction are in a different class . the big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics ?  i guess i m still not clear on what the term candida bloom means , but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use . this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome , the quack diagnosis that has been being discussed .   found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida . women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams.  lucky how ? since a recent article randomized controlled trial of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis , i have mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily . it turns out most would rather just use anti fungal creams when they get yeast infections .  yogurt dangerous . if this were a standard part of medical practice , as gordon r . says it is , then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline .  again , this just isn not what the systemic yeast syndrome is about , and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed . there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy don not seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea , but i don not think anyone would view this as a quack therapy .  david rind yogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l . bulgaricus . l . acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free . most of the commercial yogurt sold in the u.s. has a very low l . acidophilus and l . bulgaricus count . neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem . gordon r . has told me through email that he gives his patients l . acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes which set up shop in the colon but he hasn not told me which ones yet . the lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance mouth , anus , sinus cavity and vagina . having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina . i have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms. i know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body . i m not ready to buy that yet . i do believe that complications at specific sites vagina , anal and maybe lower colon , sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked . restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way in my opinion to get rid of the problem . anti fungals , a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the ph to basically starve the candida out . marty b .

5			understanding	christian	faith	truth	church	manufacturer	adam	passage	roman	testament	fire	context	tradition	bible	god	explanation	scripture	arrogance			 the arrogance of christians in the new testament sorry i don not have a bible at work , and can not provide a reference , women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church . now , this is scripture . by your definition , this is truth and therefore absolute .  do women in your church speak ? do they cover their heads ? if all scripture is absolute truth , it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals . yet , clearly , women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads . at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew up in .  evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth . and there are plenty of other examples . can you reconcile this ? the problem you see here is that some christians claim things about the bible which they don not actually believe or practice . i have known all sorts of christians , ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire breathing fundamentalists , and although many on the conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible is a perhaps the source of absolute truth , i don not know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition . while i am not a roman catholic , i believe this is close to the official position of the rc church perhaps an rc would like to comment . the particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time . you would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat and cane and give you some big song and dance routine about why this other passages as well aren not directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the bible and what they actually practice are two different things , but mostly it doens not . while this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of christians , i would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy , in this case , making claims about the bible which the claimants don not actually put into practice . but if we step back from the name calling and look at what people are attempting to say , we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the bible holds within the christian faith . so when people use such words or phrases as word of god , inerrant , infallibale , the manufacturer's handbook , the only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the bible , we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use . some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self contradictory , but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions . a biblical example is from the garden of eden where god asks where are you ? and adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself . if adam had answered god's words he would have said something like i m here in this tree . the problem seems to arise when christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif . most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use . i hope this helps .   bill rea o o w u w bill rea , computer services centre , email university of canterbury , or christchurch , new zealand phone 03 642 331 fax 03 642 999

5			faith	lord	birth	soul	car	love	relation	understanding	marriage	state	god	homosexuality	meaning	relationship			 divorce i deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce .  along the way , she was married , happily , to a wonderful and supportive husband and gave birth to two sons . still , everything was not perfect for jane , since she could never open up the deepest part of her soul to her husband . she always found that she could be much closer to her women friends than to her husband , as good and loing as a husband as he might be . she struggled very much with this until at the age of 38 , she decided that she was a lesbian . when she came home to announce this understanding of herself , her husband told her that he had come to the same understanding several years before and was waiting for her to come to that realization in her own time . her children ages 9 and 11 at the time were also extremely supportive of her . as the youngest put it , that just means that you love people very much . jane and her husband agreed to divorce but remain friends and still consider each other as part of the extended family to this day . one of the interesting things that jane said in this whole discussion was homosexuality is not about what goes on in the bedroom . she found that she was much more able to have a deep , committed relationship with a woman than a man . sex , in her mind , is only a part of the whole relationship . the key thing is how one interconnects with other people . she made a specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man , since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years . take a few seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications ! i have thought about the implications , and it is scary . we have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger , more attractive woman . if we accept that it is legitimate for jane to have divorced , how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more deep , committed relationship . marriage is not a state of being , it is a mutual journey in life . love is not a passive feeling , it must be actively willed . is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because he can not be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde ? the real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort . hold fast to the faith . has not the lord repeatedly compared his relation to his people as a faithful and enduring husband ? we learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial . my spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed . if it were to resume growing it is in remission , thanks be to god ! then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations . that's life . the lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my needs . the idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple grows apart seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that i feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise . we have become so petty and small minded that some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the wives lose weight ! i praise the lord for guiding me to marry my wife . she married me anyway despite the possibility that i could have a terrible illness . and it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor , but had i known i wouldn not have cared either . and maybe i will be in a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down . a married couple should deal with these situations with the help of the lord , not divorce and run away from them .

1			customer	price	nature	content	industry	file			 disappointed by la cie approximately four months ago , i purchased a quantum 240lps hd from la cie for $ 649 . after two months , the drive started having problems. first , there were intermittent freezes , then corrupted files and resources , then silverlining 5 . 41 wouldn not even recognize the drive . so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one . well , about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. often , when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark . sometimes , if i then insert the silverlining 5 . 42 program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives . at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd . i have called la cie again and they have given me another rma . their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn not see the drive there's a definite hardware problem . given that this is the second bad drive in four months , i asked la cie to send me a new one , but they said no. also , within three weeks after i purchased my original drive , la cie dropped the price on it by over $ 100 . i can accept that a drive or two may be bad . and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs . and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations . nevertheless , taken together , the convergence of these facts events have left a bad taste in my mouth . i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send i think the data is still in good shape and i will have to again reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me $ 250 for data recovery . it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price , and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a 90 day warranty should be new . i feel a little helpless about all this . i don not mean to necessarily flame la cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful . but c mon . sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way . i sent a letter to la cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price . i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product . they didn not even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other . what's the moral of this story ? i m not sure . but i do know i won not buy any other products from la cie in the future . bill krauthammer ps please don not email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been . i m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that . all i m saying is that i have had a disappointing experience with them and i will be taking my business elsewhere in the future .

3			candida	disease	doctor	patient	medicine	tradition			 good grief ! was re candida albicans what is it ? reply to jacquelin aldridge  medicine is not a totally scientific endevour .  the acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific . the application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than science .  there are diseases that haven not been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren not known . read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them . after scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose . and it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn not have all the answers .  certainly we don not have all the answers . the question is , what is the most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge ? the scientific method has proven itself to be reliable . the only reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny , insisting that tradition or anecdotal evidence are sufficient . these have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge . crook's ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence . his unwillingness to do good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions .  david nye . midelfort clinic , eau claire wi this is patently absurd ; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities . bertrand russell

5			swap	prayer	priest	agency	privacy	state	car	management	mr.	building			 harrassed at work , could use some prayers well , i will email also , but this may apply to other people , so i will post also . i have been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs . i m female . yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i have been sexually harrassed at this company . i dreaded coming back to work today . what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question . your boss should be the person bring these problems to . if he she does not seem to take any action , keep going up higher and higher . sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated , and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it . if you feel you can not discuss this with your boss , perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy . most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs . it is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not . it is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems strife even after eight years it's a miracle if they do notice . perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups ? if the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem , there may be a state agency willing to fight with you . check with a lawyer , a women's resource center , etc to find out you may also want to discuss this with your paster , priest , husband , etc. that is , someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive , comforting , etc. this will bring a lot of healing . so i returned at 11 25 , only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch . they left at 11 15 or so . no one could be bothered to call me at the other building , even though my number was posted . this happens to a lot of people . honest i believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through . people in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are maybe it's the hustle or stress or . i have had this happen to me a lot , often because they didn not realize my car was broken , etc. then they will come back and wonder why i didn not want to go this would tend to make me stop being angry at being ignored and make me laugh . once , we went off without our boss , who was paying for the lunch for this reason i hope good mr. moderator allows me this latest indulgence . well , if you can not turn to the computer for support , what would we do ? signs of the computer age in closing , please don not let the hateful actions of a single person harm you . they are doing it because they are still the playground bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause . and you should not accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless much wiser people hold you in great esteem .  darin johnson luxury ! in my day , we had to make do with 5 bytes of swap .
3			truth	logic	technology	mr.			 is msg sensitivity superstition ?  now here is a new one vomiting . my guess is that msg becomes the number one suspect of any problem . in this case . it might be just food poisoning . but if you heard things about msg , you may think it must be it .    yeah , it might , if you only read the part you quoted . you somehow left out the part about we all ate the same thing . changes things a bit , eh ? food poisoning is only one of the many possible causes . yes , even other people share the food .  you complain that people blame msg automatically , since it's an unknown and therefore must be the cause . it is equally if not more unreasonable to defend it , automatically assuming that it can not be the culprit . boy , you computer people only know 1s and 0s , but not much about logic . no. i did not said msg was not the culprit . what i argued was that that there was enough reasonable doubt to convict msg . if you want to convict msg , show me the evidence , not quilty by suspicion . pepper makes me sneeze . if it doesn not affect you the same way , fine . just don not tell me i m wrong for saying so . nobody is forcing you to change what you believe . but i certainly don not want to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him her sneeze . that is exactly what some anti msg activitiests are doing these people aren not condemning chinese food , mr. chen just one of its optional ingredients . try not to take it so personally . look , people with a last chen don not necessarily own a chinese restaurant . i am not interested if you enjoy chinese food or not . exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt . what i am interested in is the truth . let me give you an excert from a recent fda hearing there is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain , said dr. richard wurtman of massachusetts institute of technology . the anecdotal experiences of individuals is superstition , not science , he said . i don not think glutamate has made them sick . and dr. robert kenney of george washington university conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to msg also had similar reaction when they thought they had msg but actually not . although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group , some of them might have been due to other causes . but because the anti msg emotion runs so high , that some blame it for anything and everything . my purpose is to present a balance view on the issue , although i am probably 20 1 outnumbered . jason chen

4			price	building	arm	regulation	police	crime	waco	firearm	murder	existence	batf	agency	right	incident	fire	gun	liberty	amendment	officer	car	citizen	guard			 don kates talk on the branch davidians kates this was posted by lyn bates to the firearms politics mailing list i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation . of course , this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion . so , yesterday i went to hear him . what follows is a rough summary of what i think i heard him say , which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said . kates started by saying that since he didn not know any more about the fire than the audience did it had just happened the day before , he would not discuss that , but would concentrate on the original raid . koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck . but so what ? this isn not the first time that the leader of a new , small religious group has been ridiculed by the public . extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust the first amendment applies , maybe especially , to people like koresh . lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us . there were none until about 1830 , when they began in metropolitan areas . police originally were not armed ; if they found a crime in progress , they called local armed citizens to help . many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them , eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns . the original intent was to have many small police departments , jealous of one another and competitive , but not large enough to be a threat to liberty , hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard when the fbi was started , agents did not have the authority oto carry guns they were to be , after all , a bureau of investigation , not a police force . all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power . the batf started as a tax collection agency , whose primary job was to raid illegal stills . when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable , many illegal stills disappeared , and the batf needed something else to do to justify its existence , so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores . around the time when the batf's annual budget is under review , the media is alerted by the batf to come to such and such a place , where at a pre arranged time , a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly . the media isn not invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork , but if any irregularities are found , the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises , and the luckless ffl in chains . the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf's budget was up for review . kates opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad , and that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at , or they would have planned the raid differently not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover , for example , and would have had some medical personnel on hand . he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge , and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it . koresh sais , ok , come pick me up , and the sheriff did , temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested . koresh was later cleared , release , and presumably got his guns back . at least at that time , he was rational enough to be approached rationally , and behaved in a reasonable manner . the batf didn not take into account that , unlike most of the ffl's they audit , koresh was actually paranoid , and fostered paranoia in his followers . thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them , and they reacted accordingly . with respect to the original warrant , it had not been unsealed when kates was giving his talk , so he could not comment on it , except to mention that the batf has been known to not double check the veractiy of their informants , if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant . he had more to say about the way the warrant was served , which may have been completely illegal . apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you are an officer with a warrant for thus and so ; if they don not open the door and the evidence is flushable , then it is ok to break in the door . but since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet , there may have been no justification for the batf breaking in the way they did . if the constitutional rights of the davidians were violated by an invalid warrant , or by an improperly served warrant , then the davidians may have been justified in their actons . a close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent may have shot himself by accident when entering the building ; if so , this was the first shot fired ! the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse . after an initial position on the side of the batf , the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad , possibly illegal attack . a real cynic might say that the fbi went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides , and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy . should the batf be abolished ? no. police agencies should be numerous , diverse , inefficient , decentralized , etc. better a few inept accidents like this , than a move toward a single , large , well organized , well trained , powerful , domestic police force , which would eventually have even more tragic results . lyn bates  ps don kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at boston college law school next tuesday , april 27 . i don not know the exact time or place , but presumably a phone call to the bc law school could elicit that information .  larry cipriani

1			grace	setup	crash	windows			 consumer warning midwest micro ohio i ran out of time on my last reply to this string and i don not know if it was sent or not but . i have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with midwest micro . they may of thought that you didn not know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem . but it sounded as you didn not give them much of a chance to correct things at all . the fact that the ppi worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can not understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his her system . when you find out things like the fact the the ec led that looks like you have connected to another ec modem , doesn not realy say that . but that it only tells you that you have ec turned on , on your modem . i think that these led are nothing more that just light to hype up the product . just like i bet someone took home a few extra $ $ $ in the last year for giving the ppi modems the pc magazine award of the year . not so for the stash 12 of them that i saw on my test bench . i could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems that i found with the ppi modems but i will try to control myself . i will not even go into the 6 weeks it took ppi to credit my card back for the modems after they had received them back . no i will not go into that one nor will i go into talking to the parent co . co from hayes . i will just say i hope you like your new modem and maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get the one that you sent back , maybe a good friend of mine i hope !  gosh . i think i just installed a virus . it was called ms dos6 . don not copy that floppy . burn it . i just love windows . crash .

4			relationship	communication			 new study out on gay percentage  you might except that gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are .  okay claytoon , let us say that hypothetically i agree with you that gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men . why does this indicate they are screwed up people ?  btw it occurs to me that since , in my experience , men are much more interested in sex than women and want to have sex much earlier in a relationship than women do , that homosexuals would have sex more often simply becuase their partner is of a like mind . i.e. heterosexual men would be more promiscuous if they could . it's my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly indoctronated into now wanting sex that are men . also there are definite double standards for men and women who are promiscuous . could there also be a factor of communication being more direct in homosexual relationships and culture .   mark evans 44 21 429 9199 home 44 21 359 6531 x4039 office

1			wire	communication	escape	understanding	concept	telephone	setup	technique	game	link	ibm			 how is a null modem cable ?  i am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem cable . actually i have no idea , so don not count that last statement . what i m asking is what pins does it use or what are it's specifications ? i just want to solder one myself instead of buying one . i don not even know what port is used .  help me please at  kevin  ps i m intending to use the cable for pc to pc transfers via lap link or telix . ideas and info gladly accepted . i do not have specific knowledge of lap link or telix , but my recommendation for any package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null modem cable . the reason is that each one may be different since there isn not really a standard for pc to pc communications . the following is a tutorial i wrote up that will give you an understanding about rs 232 and null modems , but you should still check your software ! i will eplain a couple of details of rs 232 . rs 232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem . actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware . the terminology used is data terminal equipment dte and data communications equipment dce . rs 232 spells out the voltage levels , the connector type , the pinouts , and the signal protocols . the connector is a db 25 but ibm has set an alternative standard of db 9 . the primary signals are transmit data td , recieve data rd , and signal ground sg . there are other signals that provide control between the dte and the dce . for example , the dte announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the data terminal ready dtr signal . dtr is an output on the dte and an input on the dce . similarly , the dce announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the data set ready dsr signal . dsr is an input on the dte and an output on the dce . ok that's five signals ; there are only four more of interest the request to send rts signal is an output from the dte and an input to the dce that is used to ask the dce permission to send data . if the dce agrees , it sends an ok via the clear to send cts signal . for completeness , the cts is an input to the dte and an output from the dce . the other two signals of interest are ring indicator ri and data carrier detect dcd . these are both inputs to the dte and outputs from the dce . ri is just what you would expect a signal to the dte saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the dce . this is rather specific to the modem telephone line setup . dcd is a way for the dce to announce that the connection has been established i.e. the local dce is talking to some remote dce . there that's it . oh there are many other rs 232 signals defined , but they are obsolete . i have explained the nine signals that are on a pc . the pinouts are as follows name db 9 db 25 sg 5 7 td 3 2 rd 2 3 dtr 4 20 dsr 6 6 dcd 1 8 rts 7 4 cts 8 5 ri 9 22 now to address your problem at hand . when you connect a pc to a pc a dte to a dte , there is no dce pair in the middle and therefore the rs 232 signal definitions don not work out quite right . there is no dce to assert the cts , dsr , dcd , or ri . so the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all and also forget about the dtr and rts outputs as well . if this is done you simply make a null modem a cable that passes through sg , and crosses td and rd i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end , etc . the problem with this solution is that a pc that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other pc is ready . it would have to just send the data and hope it got through . therefore a better null modem would include the dtr dsr pair crossed . a particular point a confusion is in the software area . just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft ware will use them . if you are using the built in bios to control the serial port , then the bios dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used . but if you have a comm . package such as brooklyn bridge , or lap link or telix , then those packages dictate the cabling requirements . the only thing you can guess reliably is the sg , td , and rd the dtr dsr is also fairly common . there is one more issue that needs to be addressed here . and that is flow control . in the rs 232 scenerio , the dce's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the dce couldn not possible over run the dte . by this i mean that as long as the dte has its dtr line asserted , the dce will send data without requesting permission first note the contrast to the other direction of data flow the dte must request permission by asserting the rts line and it must wait for the cts signal before it can send . and now in the dte to dte scenerio , the question is do you need flow control ? the answser is usually . but how ? for non binary communications , one common technique is xon xoff which is implemented in software no wires are dedicated to flow control ; the td and rd carry the xon and xoff commands . this type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control , but the problem is that you can not send binary data because your data might include the xon or xoff codes and cause erroneous conrol signals . a work around is to have the software insert and extract escape codes , but the hardware flow control is prefered . the problem with hard ware flow control is that there is no standard there are lots of ways to do it and i bet they have all been tried . one cornerstone of all the methods is to use the rts cts for one direction . but beyond that anything is fair game . again , you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements . but i bet you will find that one cable if wired properly could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage . by the way , i am familiar with one package that uses rts cts and dtr dsr for flow control the rts is request to send and the dtr is ready to recieve , the cts is the clear to send and the dsr is the request to recieve . this does not mean a differnt cable it is just software . the clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the uart directly controlled by the cts signal which means that the cts must be present even if you are not support ing it in software . for these cases you will find cables that short the rts to the cts at the same end or perhaps the dtr to the cts . other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don not have or don not feel like providing because it would mean additional wires . specifically i am talking about the dsr . shorting the dtr to the dsr is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this . it is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose . one more gotcha signal is the dcd . some software including the pc bios expects to see the dcd before it will work . this signal sometimes gets shorted with the dtr . but my favorite null modem has the rts and cts shorted at each end , but the rts is also connected through to the other end and connected to dcd . and of course the dtr dsr are crossed as are the td rd and of course the sg must pass through . this null modem works with most software . the flow control , if any , can use the rts dcd with the dtr dsr . if your comm . package does not specify the cable required for pc to pc connection , then i suggest you use this one . td rd rd td dtr dsr dsr dtr dcd rts rts dcd cts cts gordon lang

5			christ	roman	homosexuality	love	christian	god	context	christianity	sinner	sin	lord			 hate the sin . hate the sin but love the sinner . i have heard that quite a bit recently , often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality . but the context really isn not that important . my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity . i would think not .  hate begets more hate , never love . consider some sin . i will leave it unnamed since i don not want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin . now lets apply our hate the sin . philosophy and see what happens . if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the stronger our hatred of it will become . eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner . in addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin . after enough of this , the sinner begins to hate us they certainly don not love us for our constant criticism of their behavior . hate builds up and drives people away from god . this certainly cannot be a good way to build love . i don not agree , but i can only speak for myself . i have a good friend whose lifestyle is very sinful . do i hate the things she does to herself and others ? yes . do i hate her ? absolutely not . in fact , she tells me repeatedly that i am the best friend she has in the world . i care about her very much despite the fact that i hate how she lives her life . it's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above . i have felt it with my friend more than once . there is a very important part of christianity that you have overlooked above and makes it possible to love the sin but hate the sinner . before i look at someone else's life and sin , i look to myself and am as disgusted by what i see in me as i see in others , probably more . self righteousness is contradictory to christianity and is what makes the progression you describe happen . if a christian can truthfully quote paul and say , wretched man that i am ! romans 7 24 nasb , that christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin . if we have the attitude of the pharisee who said , i thank thee that i am not like other men . luke 18 11 nasb , we will hate both . scott at brandeis but god demonstrates his the lord bless you , and keep you ; own love for us , in that the lord make his face shine on you , while we were yet sinners , and be gracious to you ; christ died for us . the lord lift up his countenance on you , and give you peace . romans 5 8 nasb numbers 6 24 26 nasb
4			agreement	nature	army	disease	space	weapon	waco			 nature of the waco gas in a previous article , dave bernard says just heard on the network radio news a spokesman from the army saying that the type of cs gas used in waco had been banned from military use . its use is also banned by a draft international agreement on the use of chemical weapons in warfare .  the reason given was that the use causes extreme nausea , blindness , disorientation , total irrationality , raging paranoia . i don not know about the paranoia and irrationality , but the rest is pretty close , all though you left out the inability to breath . of course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged things to get away from it . i have seen teenagers flatten 200lb . drill sergeants to get out of tents full of it . which raises another issue . children would be all the more susceptible , and show the results all the earlier .  this is the stuff janet reno was told would be safe for children . what they didn not mention is that in the open , it probably wouldn not do too much harm to children , although i wouldn not use it in close proximity to infants . on the other hand , in confined spaces , the effects are greatly intensified , to the point of lethality , since a sufficient quantity of cs will displace oxygen . when running a cs chamber careful attention is paid to ventilation . i wonder if they checked to see if any of the bds were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory diseases . i doubt it .   if you were smarter , you would have these opinions .

5			church	country	spirit	love	salvation	committee	apostle	advance	god	state	belief	christ	truth	key	disciple	christian	faith	jesus	bible	scripture			 unity hello fellow netters and fellow christians , about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches . to a bible study group . alltough i do have a personal opinion on this issue , i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations .  my background member of a orthodox reformed church . let us say a little the only unity i have found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples . i came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages . since becoming a disciple , i have found that when i travel to another church in the same movement , they are just as accepting there as any other . we had a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville , ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky . one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice . that is only one area in which disciples stand out from christians . also , another part of unity is a common depth of conviction . i have also been a part of some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed . that was why they could be unified , they didn not care about the truth but delighted in getting along together . the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics . both have the same confessions ; there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our creeds . in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church . but how , that is the question .  creeds ? what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better ? so , here is a first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations ? or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures ? according to the scriptures , splits and differences of opinion are going to be there . as per a previous note , i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means . there are also differences of opinion and belief . however , scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you , for your meetings do more harm than good . in the first place , i hear that when you come together as a church , there re divisions among you , and to some extent i believe it . no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god's approval 1 corinthians 11 17 19 . how will god show his approval ? by fruitfulness see acts 2 47 , but before that , there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common . glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts 2 42 47 . god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted . look at stephen , a man full of faith and of the holy spirit acts 6 5 who was later stoned acts 7 54 60 . can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ ? one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement . i have yet to find that , but the closest one i have found is the boston church of christ movement , which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected . it is also the only one i have seen which is totally sold out to god .  a problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is a unity ? this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one .  as for cooperation , that can always occur . unity , on the other hand may never occur . as for those who think about only one church being the true one , i remind them that mark 9 38 41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with , but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement , i have heard numerous times this exact same thing , that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples . of course , few people admit that they have ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement . i know i haven not . maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you . for your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church . this has been considered as correct for years . only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process . some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc.  i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me . a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively . this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions . i would not say at all that this is something correct for a church group to do for any reason . in one of the churches i attended , for example , there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups committees organizational heads of the congregation . they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in . their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came , he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would have since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple . anyway , this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down , but is still there . so , i must warn against such division within . there's enough division without . thanks for your opinions in advance !  maarten joe fisher

2			team	hockey	league	nhl	building			 nhl team in milwaukee after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that milwaukee should have an nhl team , i thought i would pass along a story i heard recently . this is second hand , so i don not know how true it is , but i have no reason to doubt it either .  bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge hockey team . the owner of the admirals sorry , i can not remember his name either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the bradley center . lloyd pettit .  supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise , but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $ 50 million was too high .  like i said , i don not know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if it's true , don not look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon . the admirals aren not going to be forced out of the building and you won not see an nhl club and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the nba's milwaukee bucks play there as well . yes , it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for $ 50m ; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much less than that . he felt that no one would pay $ 50m for an expansion team , and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that . but the market fooled him , and 5 teams have been created for $ 50m apiece in the last three years , and even the existing teams can not be moved for less than $ 50m and i doubt that he could get one for that little . pettit gambled and lost now he will have to pay more . sg

 mr. stephanopoulos we are working on that right now .  q it's been a long time .  q on february 19th , the president mentioned the value added tax in ohio . and when he was asked about it later by reporters , he said quote that is a radical change in the tax system of the united states . it's something i think we may have to look at in the years ahead . questioned again about it later he says , it is not something that is now under consideration . if we start considering it , i will tell you . it wasn not a trial balloon or anything , he said . i was just discussing the tax response to a question . donna shalala , quoted in usa today this morning quote certainly we are looking at a vat . what's gone on ?  q the same with alice rivlin this morning .  mr. stephanopoulos the health care task force is reviewing a number of options . they haven not made any decisions yet . and as i have said from this podium time and time again , we are not going to comment on decisions that haven not been made .  q but you have also said from this podium time and time again  q wait a minute . whoa , nelly . whoa .  q that that was not under consideration .  q yes . clinton says , it is not something that is now under consideration . is that no longer true ?  mr. stephanopoulos i believe the working group , as ms. shalala says , has looked at this prospect , but no decisions have been made of any kind .  q well , i know . but he said he would tell us about it if it was ever under consideration . i take it that now he is and he didn not tell us about it or  mr. stephanopoulos did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed ?  q if we start considering i will tell you .  mr. stephanopoulos if it's something to be proposed ?  q if we start considering it , i will tell you . that's a direct quote .  mr. stephanopoulos the task force has looked at a number of different options . they have not made any decisions yet . the president has not made any decisions yet . this is one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system . they have cast a very wide net . they have looked at hundreds of different proposals probably thousands of different proposals . but the president has not made any decisions .  q well , is the president aware of their consideration of this option ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if he's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind . i don not know that that's gotten to his level . he started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and i don not believe that that's been presented to him , no.  q well , he's not relying on the usa today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes .  mr. stephanopoulos no , he's going through it in a very deliberate fashion . there are a number of decisions that have to be made . i don not know that this proposal has reached that decision making point .  q if this is still under consideration , that's a change , at least from what we have been told by dee dee , i think about three weeks ago or so . she said , that is not an option , talking about the had a big argument with somebody over this , so i remember it specifically and said it not once , but twice . is that not the case ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , i don not know if this has been presented to the president as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force .  q it was ruled it out , though . i mean , unlike other options that you have kept in the mix , this one specifically was ruled out .  mr. stephanopoulos again , this is something that is being looked at , but no decision has been made of any kind . i mean , it doesn not it's not necessarily material until you get to the decision making phase . the working groups are looking at hundreds of different options .  q if it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out now , then something has changed , george . yes , no ?  q when a guy says in february  mr. stephanopoulos well , the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options .  q so something's changed . they weren not looking at it before ; they are looking at it now .  mr. stephanopoulos well , i don not know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet . they are casting a very wide net .  q how was it possible that you and dee dee were able to sell definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that , in fact , it is being considered ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , the working groups are looking at a wide range of options . they have not  q do you deny that you and dee dee ruled it flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not deny that i mean , those are the president's words . those are very clear .  q subsequent to the president's words , do you deny that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicly ruled it out ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know about the timing . i think what we did was refer back to the president's words and say they stand .  q so don not they stand any longer ?  q march 25th , clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out .  mr. stephanopoulos well , those words the president did say that in february . the working groups are on a separate track , and as i said , i don not believe  q separate from the president ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not believe this has been presented to the president .  q are they considering something that the president   q has ruled out ?  q has ruled out ? i mean , will the president consider a vat tax ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , the working groups have not presented this to the president . they have looked at a wide range of options . i suppose that if an argument is made , he will clearly listen to it . that does not mean he has decided to do it .  q can we put this another way ? in his answer in ohio , he looked at the vat in terms of restructuring the whole tax system . under those that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point . is that no longer the case , or is that the only way that he can see a vat emerging ?  mr. stephanopoulos i guess i m not sure exactly what you are asking .  q he talked about the vat in the context of a restructured tax system , not as a specific way to finance health care , for example .  q or anything else .  q or anything else .  q it was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system .  mr. stephanopoulos right .  q has that change , too ?  q is that still his view ?  mr. stephanopoulos i haven not spoken about those specific comments . i think i can just go back to it are the working groups have they examined the possibility of a vat ? yes , they have .  q certainly we are looking at a vat , she said .  mr. stephanopoulos they have examined the possibility of a vat . has it been presented to the president ? has he made a decision ? no , he has not .  q what kind of a deal do you have when you have got the president's appointed task force , obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform , goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later , and then goes ahead and announces that that's what they are looking at ? is the president concerned about that sort of thing ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think that the president's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible . he's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives , all the different alternatives . if a decision is made to go forward with something like that it's certainly something the president will explain and justify . but no decision has been made along those  q what does it mean exactly , though , when the president rules something out ? does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made ?  mr. stephanopoulos that's just that's indisputably true . if you but , at the same time , he has not ruled it in . he has not made a proposal .  q what makes him open to it now when he wasn not open to it before ?  mr. stephanopoulos he's certainly willing to listen to the argument .  q was he willing to listen to the argument for a short term tax this year , and he wasn not willing to listen to it in chilicothe ? he's now open to it  mr. stephanopoulos the context of his comments was that it was not something he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing , not something he was floating .  q not something he was considering . those are his words it's not something that's now under consideration . if we start considering it , i will tell you . you are now acknowledging , are you not , that it is under consideration and  mr. stephanopoulos i m acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal . i am also stating that the president has not made a decision on it .  q but the door is open for the president to reconsider including this as part of  mr. stephanopoulos obviously , the working groups are looking at it . again , but the president has not made a decision .  q do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the vat to him ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know that . i assume that if i don not know what stage they are it in proposing . i don not know that they are going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him . i know this is something the working groups are looking at .  q do you understand , george , that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the president has made , only about what the president is considering ?  mr. stephanopoulos i understand that , and i am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a vat .  q and the president will consider it ?  mr. stephanopoulos i assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him .  q does that mean the president that working groups think that when the president says no , he means maybe ? laughter .  mr. stephanopoulos i think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible .  q george , can i ask you another question about bosnia ?  mr. stephanopoulos sure . laughter .  q no , he wants us to stay on this .  q let's do gays in the military . laughter .  q no , he got out of that swamp .  q i think we have gotten the bottom line on that vat . reggie bartholomew , your special ambassador in belgrade , today said that if the serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out quote we will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies . that seems to go a bit further than what you have just said  mr. stephanopoulos sounds almost exactly what i just said .  q well , do you accept in other words , you accept what reggie  mr. stephanopoulos well , the president has said that this is something that's under consideration . it is something he will consider if the current actions don not bring the serbs to the table .  q isn not there some kind of timetable here ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes , there is a timetable . there's going to be a vote on the u.n. resolution in about 10 days .  q that's on sanctions , that's on tightening the sanctions .  mr. stephanopoulos that's right , that's sanctions . and we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure , and we hope that that will bring the serbs to the table . as you know , mr. bartholomew also met with mr. churkin of russia , and they are also working on ways to bring the serbs to the table . we will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well .  q the question is whether there's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo , not the sanctions .  mr. stephanopoulos the next vote in the u.n. is on sanctions . as far as i know , there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo . but it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies .  q why did reggie bartholomew tell the serbs that the u.s. would do that ? what was the point of his telling them that ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , clearly , i mean , this is something that's under consideration , and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table . they should know the consequences of failing to come to the table .  q have they been given a deadline ?  q warren christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn not seemed to change the serbs behavior in the least why should the serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the fighting in bosnia ?  mr. stephanopoulos i just don not accept the premise of your question . it has had an effect ; the embargo is having an effect .  q what effect ?  mr. stephanopoulos if the serbians choose not to heed our warnings , then they will face the consequences .  q what effect has it had in bosnia ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , the effect that it has had on the serbians , it has tightened up they are not getting their shipments through . we can brief more fully  q in bosnia , george . in bosnia what effect has it had ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , it's hard to say if it's stopped the aggression to date . that is why we are continuing to press for the serbians to stop . but we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the serbs and that will have an effect . i m not saying it's going to happen overnight ; it clearly hasn not happened overnight . but we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the serbs . if it fails to work and if the serbs fail to come to the negotiating table , we will move forward with the embargo .  q isn not there a working deadline , george , of the 24th the same date as the u.n. the scheduled u.n. vote ? hasn not the united states said , along with many of the other nato allies , that if the serbs aren not willing to sign on to the peace accord by then , that we will seek haven not we said that we will seek  mr. stephanopoulos we have said continually we are going to  q but on that deadline ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not have a specific date , but we are going to move forward with the resolution , the u.n. resolution , by around that time . and if that fails to take effect , if that fails to bring the serbs to the table , we will clearly consider other actions .  q isn not this awfully incremental ?  mr. stephanopoulos we are taking a step by step approach . we are ratcheting up the pressure and we are going to continue to do that .  q is there a possibility , george , that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the serbs will have achieved their goals and then what's the purpose ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think the purpose is to get the serbs to stop the aggression . we are pursuing that goal on many different fronts . we are pursuing it through the u.n . we are pursuing it through direct talks ; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions . and we will consider lifting the arms embargo . we are turning the screws up on the serbs and we will continue to do that .  q but if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the serbs give back what they have gained ? i mean , once they are entrenched  mr. stephanopoulos i can not speculate on that . we are going to continue to press for them to come to the table now . we are going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression . but i can not see into the future .  q george , on the stimulus package , house republicans say they are going to hold a series of town meetings on saturday to try and explain the details of your package . they cite polls which show that the more people learn about it , the less they like it . what's your strategy to counter that ?  mr. stephanopoulos the strategy we have is the one we are going to continue . as you saw , the president today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide 700 , 000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work . we are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money , the investments in highways . we are going to point up the benefits of immunization . we are going to point up the benefits of head start . we are going to say that the republicans have a choice they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years .  q does it concern you , though , that the house now , the house republicans are after you as well as the senate ?  mr. stephanopoulos the house republicans voted against it before . they made a mistake then ; they are making a mistake now .  q george , does it strike anybody in the administration that it's a bit strong to describe , as the president did this morning , the summer jobs program as quote a reaffirmation of a promise of america ?  mr. stephanopoulos not at all . i think it's the promise of america to give kids a chance to reach their full potential .  q government funded jobs ?  mr. stephanopoulos to give people a chance to work ? absolutely . that is the promise of america .  q i want to follow up on something i asked yesterday where does 700 , 000 summer jobs , where does that figure come from ?  mr. stephanopoulos that is on top of . i did look at it . there are currently 600 , 000 summer jobs in the pipeline . this will be on top of the 600 , 000 , so it will be a total of 1 . 3 million .  q the 700 , 000 would be created by the stimulus package ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q where does that number come from ? because we have been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500 , 000 new jobs . and according to panetta , that breaks down to something like 200 , 000 full time jobs and 150 , 000 summer jobs .  mr. stephanopoulos yes , but the summer that's when you do their full time equivalence . i mean , 700 , 000 individuals will receive jobs this summer . when you calculate it for the full time job effect , you have to do i don not know what the exact formula is .  q seven hundred thousand part time jobs  mr. stephanopoulos 150 , 000 or  q one to four because it's three months .  mr. stephanopoulos thank you .  q can i follow up on that ? did the president misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private for kids to work in the private sector ?  mr. stephanopoulos not necessarily . i mean , i think that there will be grants available . that's one of the ways that you pay for the jobs . at the same time , he's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well .  q tax dollars , for instance , would pay for kids to work at time warner ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think the time warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant . that's going to be the bulk of it . there could be isolated instances , though , where there would be grants to businesses .  q has the president spoken with any senate republicans this week ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , but there's been a lot of contact with senate republicans in the white house .  q at a lower level . but the president hasn not ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president has not , no.  q getting any closer to get the votes ?  mr. stephanopoulos we are continuing to work on it .  q anybody leaning your way ?  q on haiti , the new york times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in aristide's attitude towards the coup leaders . can you confirm that there has been this change , and what impact will it have on the process ? and what did pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report ?  mr. stephanopoulos pezzullo did brief the principals . i can not confirm what's actually happening in the talks . i would leave that to the negotiators themselves . but mr. caputo has returned to haiti . we have received a briefing here at the white house from ambassador pezzullo . and as we have said time and time again , we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement .  q george , yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities . can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think we have it for most states , yes . and i think we can get it out .  q could you make that generally available ?  mr. stephanopoulos i believe we can .  q and could you do it by the component of the stimulus ? in other words  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if we can do i know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs . i don not know how deeply it can be broken down . but clearly , we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs .  q and can i follow up ? is this the information that jeff eller and the rest of the white house is using in the ads in the states ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if they are ads , but they are press releases .  q can you describe what those press releases contain ?  mr. stephanopoulos all we are doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states . for instance , i know that today senator dole is heading up to vermont and new hampshire . and i would point out that the stimulus package , the jobs package creates 1 , 000 jobs in vermont . it creates 2 , 000 jobs in new hampshire . and the people of those states should remind him that this is important .  q where are the releases going ?  mr. stephanopoulos they go to the states .  q to whom ?  mr. stephanopoulos we can get them . it's no problem .  q can we get it ?  q why don not you put them out here as well ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think we can .  q this afternoon ? would that be possible ?  mr. stephanopoulos i will have to check . i don not know . but as soon as we can .  q are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic republican senators ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think we are trying to get as many as we can . it's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we are doing our best we are putting them out as we get them .  q why are you so closely tracking senator dole's schedule ?  mr. stephanopoulos i was just following it .  q are press releases going along to states where he's visiting ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not sure . i think that probably there are press releases going to vermont . laughter .  q will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting ? laughter .  q george , as the president goes about the business of defending what's in his stimulus package , he doesn not address what seems to be the republicans main point , that you are funding it with deficit spending rather than if it's so important , why not come up with the funding for it seems to be the republican argument . and how do you answer that ?  mr. stephanopoulos what was answer is , we are paying for it over time . and if you look at our budget , we pay for this package over time . we believe right now the economy needs a jump start for jobs .  q you are not claiming , are you , that that doesn not add to the deficit this year ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m saying we are paying for it over time . i didn not say that .  q i know that , george . but i mean , from the beginning , the question we do have annual budgets and things deficit spending will pay for that this year , will it not ?  mr. stephanopoulos this year they clearly will . but over time our budget fully pays for this program .  q what you are saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years ?  mr. stephanopoulos absolutely . that's exactly what i said .  q i know that , but there is going to be outstanding debt , it will add to the national debt from this year  mr. stephanopoulos no , we are reducing the deficit by $ 500 billion $ 514 billion over the next four years .  q you mean you are reducing it below what it would have been ?  mr. stephanopoulos exactly .  q in fact , you are adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of  mr. stephanopoulos but we are reducing it far more from what it would have been . that's true .  q washington type reduction . laughter .  q you are getting to be a grumpy old man .  q george , has any decision been made about the white house or the president's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half ?  mr. stephanopoulos we are working on the president's schedule now . i believe he's going to be at the senate democratic retreat in jamestown that weekend .  q will he address it by phone ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know about that . it's a little far out , but i believe he's going to be in the senate retreat .  q so will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know . i would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups . i don not know the schedule on it , though .  q will there be an aids czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m just not sure .  q april 22nd is earth day . what is the president going to do to mark that , and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day ?  mr. stephanopoulos i know there's been some work on the biodiversity treaty . i don not know about signing it that day , but i would expect he will have a statement on earth day or right around then .  q where is the work on the biodiversity treaty ?  mr. stephanopoulos i would have to check with katie mcginty . i just know that there's been some work done , but i don not know exactly what .  q when is earth day ?  mr. stephanopoulos the 22nd , i think .  q why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on earth day but you don not know if he's going to have a statement on the gay rights march ?  mr. stephanopoulos i said i don not know if he's going to meet or when he's going to meet .  q do you have a statement on the gay rights march ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not , actually , no. i wouldn not be surprised if he did , though .  q do you have some details on the miyazawa visit ?  mr. stephanopoulos it's a working visit on friday and the president is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including russian aid and the japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries .  q there was some expectations that a second aid package to russia was going to be unveiled at the g 7 meeting and , if i understand , it hasn not happened . why is that or what's the status on that ?  mr. stephanopoulos the g 7 meeting is still going on and , as you know , secretaries bentsen and christopher have talked continue to consult with congress and our g 7 allies on that .  q ? we will not then make any kind of announcement during the two day meeting ?  mr. stephanopoulos the meeting's not over yet .  q is that when you are going to make one ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not ruling out the possibility .  q the president's going to announce it tomorrow .  q bentsen said that .  q yes , bentsen said it would be tomorrow .  q so did christopher .  mr. stephanopoulos i would have to look at that , but i believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of tokyo .  q george , has there been further consideration here about going to sending the president out to los angeles ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know that there's it's not something we have ruled out . we don not have a date set for it .  q george , you all have a position or do you support immigration's plan to settle 4 , 000 iraqi prisoners in the united states ?  mr. stephanopoulos it's the first i have heard of it .  q george , there was a report today about the  q fortunately . laughter .  q about the pace of appointments and says that president clinton is behind president bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for . are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it ?  mr. stephanopoulos we filled 814 of the president's appointments . and it's broken down we have 384 schedule c ; 147 noncareer ses ; 213 pas full time . i m not sure what that means laughter 70 pa full time . and this is about the same it's about the same pace of president bush . obviously , as you move along farther , once you each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments . so we expect the process to speed up . but we are at the pace of bush . obviously we would like to get these done as quickly as possible .  i would point out that the fbi background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors , and that is part of the holdup . but we are working on it .  q is that because of nannygate ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think that's an awful big part of it , yes .  q in the story this morning , you were at approximately the same pace as bush in making appointments , but way behind in winning confirmations .  mr. stephanopoulos that's where the background checks comes into play . that's the problem .  q that's the background checks problem ? because i mean , you have a democratic senate  mr. stephanopoulos no , that's not the you make the appointments , and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done . that's exactly where the problem is .  q what's the president doing this afternoon , and what's on the plan for tomorrow ?  mr. stephanopoulos he's got some meetings just office meetings this afternoon for the most part , on a variety of issues that probably a half dozen different issues . and then he will be tomorrow we will have an event , probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the white house . and friday is the miyazawa meeting .  q will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow , george ?  mr. stephanopoulos either tomorrow or friday .  q is there going to be a pre briefing regarding the japanese prime minister's visit tomorrow ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know about tomorrow , but we will probably get something done , as we usually do , for these visits .  q was reverend jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about ?  mr. stephanopoulos he was here . he met with a group of us here at the white house , including mack mclarty .  q who ?  q reverend jackson .  mr. stephanopoulos reverend jackson . mack mclarty , me , gene sperling , bruce reed , jeff watson , mark gearan .  q talking about haiti ?  mr. stephanopoulos we talked about general urban policy . he is about to go to los angeles . he was just back from mississippi , where we had a good victory last night ; and he's going on to los angeles .  q did he request the meeting ?  mr. stephanopoulos actually , no. he's in continual contact with the president . he had written a letter on a variety of issues , and so we asked him to come in and talk about it .  q george , dole is having a fundraiser for jeffords tonight in vermont . have you guys been in contact with jeffords at all on this ? mr. stephanopoulos i think there's been some contact , sure .  q can you tell us about the contacts ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not sure  q do you know who contacted him or what was said ?  mr. stephanopoulos i know that howard paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package .  q and did he express his support for it now , or is he   mr. stephanopoulos i can not divulge the details of the conversation , but there have been conversations .  q the l . a . times is reporting that abortion elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package . is this something the president is considering ?  mr. stephanopoulos again  q along with the vat ? laughter .  mr. stephanopoulos it's certainly something that's been looked at , but no decisions have been made .  q what was the question ?  mr. stephanopoulos the l . a . times story on whether abortions will be covered by the president's health plan .  q did the president in his meeting did you in your meeting with reverend jackson ask his advice , solicit his advice about what kind of stance the white house should take in the wake of the verdict in l . a .  mr. stephanopoulos well , we certainly talked about the situation in los angeles and the long term prospects for economic development and other issues .  q for instance , did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the president to go there or not ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , we discussed a wide range of issues related to los angeles . that was certainly one of them .  q letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in , i need to go back to bosnia just for a second and ask  mr. stephanopoulos oh , good .  q your reaction to margaret thatcher's comments that you are just sitting by and watching a massacre .  mr. stephanopoulos well , we have been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action . we will continue to do that .  q can you tell us if you have made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise ? i mean , we don not have any feel except talks are ongoing . have you talked to like 20 people or  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know the numbers . we have talked to several people and we have had wide ranging sessions .  q anyone leaning your way ?  mr. stephanopoulos i can not get into that . we are just going to keep working through tuesday .  the press thank you . end 1 10 pm edt  56 04 14

5			country	state	right	citizen	vote			 the inimitable rushdie i don not think you are right about germany . my daughter was born there and i don not think she has any german rights eg to vote or live there beyond the rights of all ec citizens . she is a british citizen by virtue of her parentage , but that's not full citizenship . for example , i don not think her children could be british by virtue of her in the same way . i am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an application for it . it might require immigration to germany , but i am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable in this case . more interesting is your sentence , in fact , many people try to come to the us to have their children born here so that they will have some human rights . how does the us compare to an islamic country in this respect ? do people go to iran so their children will have some human rights ? would you ? more interesting only for your propaganda purposes . i have said several times now that i don not consider iran particularly exemplary as a good islamic state . we might talk about the rights of people in capitalist secular third world countries to give other examples of the lack of rights in third world countries broadly . say , for example , central american secular capitalist countries whose govt's the us supports but who amnesty international has pointed out are human rights vacua . gregg

3			key	ibm	nra	tradition	management	scheme	communication	technology	agency	spirit	nsa	cambridge	industry	space	escrow	privacy	encryption	cryptography	series			 facinating facts 30 bit serial number , possibly fixed s1 and s2 disclaimer this posting represents the poster's views , not those of ibm hmmm . we must assume that generating the unit key u from the serial number n rather than generating it from a randomly selected u1 and u2 is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government u is completedly determined given s1 , s2 and n . if s1 and s2 do not change they constitute effective master keys along with f , the theft of which or the possession of which by various authorities completely obviates the security of the system . however , more interestingly , we know , for a fact that if s1 and s2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for u is no more than 2 30 . why not pick u1 and u2 at random ? why this interesting restriction of they key space if it not to provide an additional back door ?  i find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin .  even if s1 and s2 change periodically , the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security .  if s1 and s2 do not change , even if they remain secret i wonder if they can somehow be back derived given enough unit key serial number pairs . we are assured that this cannot happen but no one understands how skipjack works outside of government officials and , soon , foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage . presumably we will eventually have the information as well reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year but by the time we know it may be too late . perhaps the trusted escrow agencies can be the ones who come up with s1 and s2 , and if these agencies are really trusted aclu & nra is an interesting example , we can hope that they will use some physical process to come up with truly random numbers . if the nsa comes up with the numbers , that's a trap door you could drive a truck through . none of this makes me feel the least bit secure . me either . it seems from the following that the cpsr is atleats starting to question this bogosity  april 16 , 1993 washington , dc computer professionals call for public debate on new government encryption initiative computer professionals for social responsibility cpsr today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly announced public encryption management initiative . the new cryptography scheme was announced today by the white house and the national institute for standards and technology nist , which will implement the technical specifications of the plan . a nist spokesman acknowledged that the national security agency nsa , the super secret military intelligence agency , had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built . according to nist , the technical specifications and the presidential directive establishing the plan are classified . to open the initiative to public review and debate , cpsr today filed a series of freedom of information act foia requests with key agencies , including nsa , nist , the national security council and the fbi for information relating to the encryption plan . the cpsr requests are in keeping with the spirit of the computer security act , which congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit nsa's role in the creation of such standards . cpsr previously has questioned the role of nsa in developing the so called digital signature standard dss , a communications authentication technology that nist proposed for government wide use in 1991 . after cpsr sued nist in a foia lawsuit last year , the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that nsa had , in fact , developed that security standard nsa is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the dss . david sobel , cpsr legal counsel , called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications , as reflected in today's official statement , a step in the right direction . but he questioned the propriety of nsa's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny . at a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure , it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation . it is not appropriate for nsa an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography to play a leading role in the development process . cpsr is a national public interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society . cpsr has 21 chapters in the u.s. and maintains offices in palo alto , california , cambridge , massachusetts and washington , dc . for additional information on cpsr , call 415 322 3778 or email .  regards , ian ameline .

2			dod	launch	girl	car	mary	nasa	manufacturer	clutch	gear			 manual shift bigots in a previous article , eric youngblood says race car stuff deleted back to the f1 stuff for a second , note that the auto tranny in f1 still shifts at the driver's command , not some preselected schedule . the driver still controls the shifting , not the transmission . now , there is no dispute that in production cars , automatics are inherently more lossy than manuals . that is in theory . my point all along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isn not skillful or one thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that it has a torque converter vs a clutch . i know this sounds strange but , a torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching . it functions  as a sort of limited continuously variable transmission . typically you get a torque multiplication of 2 to 3 times depending on the stall speed . i have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile . such systems do exist , but none are presently installed in production autos that i am aware of . these are commonly called viscous drive cvts or fluidic amplifiers . contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no tq mult what the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's driveline . chevy proved it many years ago with the 70 camaro ets and terminal 1 4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and auto cars . note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual , the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed 5 sspeed autos soon to be out , note that some manufacturers are using 6 speed manulas now . once past lauch however , the converter begins coupling and the tq multiplication effect is reduced , but by then you should be on the cam . correct .  al bowers dod 900 alfa ducati hobie kottke blad iaido nasa well goodness sakes . don not you know that girls can not play guitar ? mary chapin carpenter

this publication contact the public mail office at the nasa center in your geographic region . introduction from our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years . ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars . they called these objects planets , meaning wanderers , and named them after roman deities jupiter , king of the gods ; mars , the god of war ; mercury , messenger of the gods ; venus , the god of love and beauty , and saturn , father of jupiter and god of agriculture . the stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails , and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky . science flourished during the european renaissance . fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered , and the orbits of the planets around the sun were calculated . in the 17th century , astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries . but the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration . advancements in rocketry after world war ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earth's gravity and travel to the moon and to other planets . the united states has sent automated spacecraft , then human crewed expeditions , to explore the moon . our automated machines have orbited and landed on venus and mars ; explored the sun's environment ; observed comets , and made close range surveys while flying past mercury , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune . these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system . through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft , color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to earth bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light . and dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered . future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century .  automated spacecraft the national aeronautics and space administration's nasa's automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes . while they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives , the craft share much in common . each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission , supported by basic subsystems for electrical power , trajectory and orientation control , as well as for processing data and communicating with earth . electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. nasa uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions . rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power . imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet , only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target ! to help prevent such a mishap , a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft . the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars . just as earth's early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans , spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space . with the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference , flight controllers can keep a spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward earth . the thrusters can also be used to fine tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory . between 1959 and 1971 , nasa spacecraft were dispatched to study the moon and the solar environment ; they also scanned the inner planets other than earth mercury , venus and mars . these three worlds , and our own , are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid rock composition . for the early planetary reconnaissance missions , nasa employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the mariners . their flights helped shape the planning of later missions . between 1962 and 1975 , seven mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space . all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power source . the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells . other mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies . although the mariners ranged from the mariner 2 venus spacecraft , weighing in at 203 kilograms 447 pounds , to the mariner 9 mars orbiter , weighing in at 974 kilograms 2 , 147 pounds , their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program . the mariner 5 venus spacecraft , for example , had originally been a backup for the mariner 4 mars flyby . the mariner 10 spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components left over from the mariner 9 mars orbiter program . in 1972 , nasa launched pioneer 10 , a jupiter spacecraft . interest was shifting to four of the outer planets jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed . four nasa spacecraft in all two pioneers and two voyagers were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system . because of the distances involved , these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations . barring faster spacecraft , they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars . because the sun's light becomes so faint in the outer solar system , these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes . nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late 1970s . twin viking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories . two advanced orbiters descendants of the mariner craft carried the viking landers from earth and then studied martian features from above . two drum shaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in 1978 . the pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planet's dense cloud cover to study surface features . the pioneer venus multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds . the probes and the main body all of which contained scientific instruments radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their descent toward the surface . a new generation of automated spacecraft including magellan , galileo , ulysses , mars observer , the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet .  the sun a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the sun . the sun dwarfs the other bodies , representing approximately 99 . 86 percent of all the mass in the solar system ; all of the planets , moons , asteroids , comets , dust and gas add up to only about 0 . 14 percent . this 0 . 14 percent represents the material left over from the sun's formation . one hundred and nine earths would be required to fit across the sun's disk , and its interior could hold over 1 . 3 million earths . as a star , the sun generates energy through the process of fusion . the temperature at the sun's core is 15 million degrees celsius 27 million degrees fahrenheit , and the pressure there is 340 billion times earth's air pressure at sea level . the sun's surface temperature of 5 , 500 degrees celsius 10 , 000 degrees fahrenheit seems almost chilly compared to its core temperature . at the solar core , hydrogen can fuse into helium , producing energy . the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles , both extending far beyond the planets . the sun appears to have been active for 4 . 6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so . at the end of its life , the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up , ultimately growing so large that it will swallow earth . after a billion years as a red giant , it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf the final end product of a star like ours . it may take a trillion years to cool off completely . many spacecraft have explored the sun's environment , but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two thirds of the distance from earth to the sun . pioneers 5 11 , the pioneer venus orbiter , voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment . the ulysses spacecraft , launched on october 6 , 1990 , is a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency . after using jupiter's gravity to change its trajectory , ulysses will fly over the sun's polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments . we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is . if it were different in almost any way , life would almost certainly never have developed on earth .  mercury obtaining the first close up views of mercury was the primary objective of the mariner 10 spacecraft , launched on november 3 , 1973 , from kennedy space center in florida . after a journey of nearly five months , which included a flyby of venus , the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers 437 miles of the solar system's innermost planet on march 29 , 1974 . until mariner 10 , little was known about mercury . even the best telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail . the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar glare . when the planet is visible on earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn , it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere . only radar telescopes gave any hint of mercury's surface conditions prior to the voyage of mariner 10 . the photographs mariner 10 radioed back to earth revealed an ancient , heavily cratered surface , closely resembling our own moon . the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet . these apparently were created when mercury's interior cooled and shrank , buckling the planet's crust the cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers 2 miles and as long as 500 kilometers 310 miles . instruments on mariner 10 discovered that mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere a trillionth the density of earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon , neon and helium . when the planet's orbit takes it closest to the sun , surface temperatures range from 467 degrees celsius 872 degrees fahrenheit on mercury's sunlit side to 183 degrees celsius 298 degrees fahrenheit on the dark side . this range in surface temperature 650 degrees celsius 1 , 170 degrees fahrenheit is the largest for a single body in the solar system . mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time . days and nights are long on mercury . the combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars 59 earth days and a rapid revolution around the sun 88 earth days means that one mercury solar day takes 176 earth days or two mercury years the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the sun ! mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth . scientists believe mercury has a heavy iron rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume . that would make mercury's core larger , proportionally , than the moon's core or those of any of the planets . after the initial mercury encounter , mariner 10 made two additional flybys on september 21 , 1974 , and march 16 , 1975 before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded . each flyby took place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated ; as a result , we still have not seen one half of the planet's surface .  venus veiled by dense cloud cover , venus our nearest planetary neighbor was the first planet to be explored . the mariner 2 spacecraft , launched on august 27 , 1962 , was the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the mysterious planet . as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus , plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus surface , romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest on december 14 , 1962 , mariner 2 passed within 34 , 839 kilometers 21 , 648 miles of venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet ; onboard instruments measured venus for 42 minutes . mariner 5 , launched in june 1967 , flew much closer to the planet . passing within 4 , 094 kilometers 2 , 544 miles of venus on the second american flyby , mariner 5's instruments measured the planet's magnetic field , ionosphere , radiation belts and temperatures . on its way to mercury , mariner 10 flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere . in the spring and summer of 1978 , two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of venus . on december 4 of the same year , the pioneer venus orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet . five days later , the five separate components making up the second spacecraft the pioneer venus multiprobe entered the venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet . the four small , independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface . although designed to examine the atmosphere , one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour . venus resembles earth in size , physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet . however , spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well . for example , venus rotation west to east is retrograde backward compared to the east to west spin of earth and most of the other planets . approximately 96 . 5 percent of venus atmosphere 95 times as dense as earth's is carbon dioxide . the principal constituent of earth's atmosphere is nitrogen . venus atmosphere acts like a greenhouse , permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space . as a result , the planet's average surface temperature is 482 degrees celsius 900 degrees fahrenheit , hot enough to melt lead . a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet . nasa's magellan spacecraft , launched on may 5 , 1989 , has been in orbit around venus since august 10 , 1990 . the spacecraft uses radar mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh resolution images of the surface . magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features , faults and impact craters . huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones . an elevated region named ishtar terra is a lava filled basin as large as the united states . at one end of this plateau sits maxwell montes , a mountain the size of mount everest scarring the mountain's flank is a 100 kilometer 62 mile wide , 2 . 5 kilometer 1 . 5 mile deep impact crater named cleopatra . almost all features on venus are named for women ; maxwell montes , alpha regio and beta regio are the exceptions . craters survive on venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion . extensive fault line networks cover the planet , probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on earth . but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock , which cracks just about everywhere , preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the san andreas fault in california . venus predominant weather pattern is a high altitude , high speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid . at speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers 225 miles per hour , the clouds circle the planet in only four earth days . the circulation is in the same direction west to east as venus slow rotation of 243 earth days , whereas earth's winds blow in both directions west to east and east to west in six alternating bands . venus atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather .  earth as viewed from space , our world's distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters , brown and green land masses and white clouds . we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen , 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents . the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life , earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers 93 million miles . earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system , with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus . our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field , which , along with the atmosphere , shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars . earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors as well , most of which burn up before they can strike the surface . active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon after it formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago . along with the other newly formed planets , it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system . from our journeys into space , we have learned much about our home planet . the first american satellite explorer 1 was launched from cape canaveral in florida on january 31 , 1958 , and discovered an intense radiation zone , now called the van allen radiation belts , surrounding earth . since then , other research satellites have revealed that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear drop shape by the solar wind the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun . we have learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries . and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere , once believed calm and uneventful , seethes with activity swelling by day and contracting by night . affected by changes in solar activity , the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth . besides affecting earth's weather , solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere . when charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in earth's magnetic field , they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles . these air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights . satellites about 35 , 789 kilometers 22 , 238 miles out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting . these watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of earth's complex weather systems. from their unique vantage points , satellites can survey earth's oceans , land use and resources , and monitor the planet's health . these eyes in space have saved countless lives , provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways .  the moon the moon is earth's single natural satellite . the first human footsteps on an alien world were made by american astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless , lifeless companion . in preparation for the human crewed apollo expeditions , nasa dispatched the automated ranger , surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between 1964 and 1968 . nasa's apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data . six two astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 , carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms 842 pounds and consisting of more than 2 , 000 separate samples . from this material and other studies , scientists have constructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy . rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4 . 0 4 . 3 billion years old . the first few million years of the moon's existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain . as a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock , the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects . some of the asteroids were as large as rhode island or delaware , and their collisions with the moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across . this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago , leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge , overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock . heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the moon at depths of about 200 kilometers 125 miles below the surface . then , for the next 700 million years from about 3 . 8 to 3 . 1 billion years ago lava rose from inside the moon . the lava gradually spread out over the surface , flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that galileo galilei , an astronomer of the italian renaissance , called maria , meaning seas . as far as we can tell , there has been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years . since then , the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites , by the atomic particles from the sun and stars , by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts . if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion years ago , they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today . thousands of years from now , the footsteps left by the apollo crews will remain sharp and clear . the origin of the moon is still a mystery . four theories attempt an explanation the moon formed near earth as a separate body ; it was torn from earth ; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet's gravity , or it was the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars . the last theory has some good support but is far from certain .  mars of all the planets , mars has long been considered the solar system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life . astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what observations later determined to be optical illusions led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet . in 1938 , when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the worlds by h . g . wells , enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic . another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's surface . this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods . so far , six american missions to mars have been carried out . four mariner spacecraft three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiters and landers arrived . mariner 4 , launched in late 1964 , flew past mars on july 14 , 1965 , coming within 9 , 846 kilometers 6 , 118 miles of the surface . transmitting to earth 22 close up pictures of the planet , the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water . mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures . mariners 4 , 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin , cold , dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide . on may 30 , 1971 , the mariner 9 orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year long study of the martian surface . the spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift off , only to find mars in the midst of a planet wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks . but after the storm cleared , mariner 9 began returning the first of 7 , 329 pictures ; these revealed previously unknown martian features , including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface , etching river valleys and flood plains . in august and september 1975 , the viking 1 and 2 spacecraft each consisting of an orbiter and a lander lifted off from kennedy space center . the mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet , including , is there life there ? nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities , but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at least find evidence of primitive life past or present . viking lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july 20 , 1976 , while the united states was celebrating its bicentennial . photos sent back from the chryse planitia plains of gold showed a bleak , rusty red landscape . panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain , littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes . fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue . when viking lander 2 touched down on utopia planitia on september 3 , 1976 , it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor one without visible dunes . the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were inconclusive . small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes . while some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity , later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil chemistry . is there life on mars ? no one knows for sure , but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there . the viking landers became weather stations , recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure . few weather changes were observed . the highest temperature recorded by either craft was 14 degrees celsius 7 degrees fahrenheit at the viking lander 1 site in midsummer . the lowest temperature , 120 degrees celsius 184 degrees fahrenheit , was recorded at the more northerly viking lander 2 site during winter . near hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms , but because the atmosphere is so thin , wind force is minimal . viking lander 2 photographed light patches of frost probably water ice during its second winter on the planet . the martian atmosphere , like that of venus , is primarily carbon dioxide . nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages . martian air contains only about 1 1 , 000 as much water as our air , but even this small amount can condense out , forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes . local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys . there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet . physical islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet . mars has two moons , phobos and deimos . they are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient , cratered surfaces . it is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to mars and were captured by its gravity . the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days , respectively . the first to fail was viking orbiter 2 , which stopped operating on july 24 , 1978 , when a leak depleted its attitude control gas . viking lander 2 operated until april 12 , 1980 , when it was shut down because of battery degeneration . viking orbiter 1 quit on august 7 , 1980 , when the last of its attitude control gas was used up . viking lander 1 ceased functioning on november 13 , 1983 . despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology experiments , we know more about mars than any other planet except earth . nasa's mars observer spacecraft , to be launched in september 1992 , will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet .  asteroids the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered full fledged planets . these objects are known as asteroids or minor planets . most , but not all , are found in a band or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter . some have orbits that cross earth's path , and there is evidence that earth has been hit by asteroids in the past one of the least eroded , best preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near winslow , arizona . asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system . one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago . more likely , asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet . in fact , if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object , the object would be only about 1 , 500 kilometers 932 miles across less than half the diameter of our moon . thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth . it is estimated that 100 , 000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through earth based telescopes . much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of earth . asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are called meteoroids . when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity , friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor . if the meteoroid does not burn up completely , what's left strikes earth's surface and is called a meteorite . one of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica . of all the meteorites examined , 92 . 8 percent are composed of silicate stone , and 5 . 7 percent are composed of iron and nickel ; the rest are a mixture of the three materials . stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks . since asteroids are material from the very early solar system , scientists are interested in their composition . spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances . current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination . the galileo orbiter , launched by nasa in october 1989 , will investigate main belt asteroids on its way to jupiter . the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini missions will also study these far flung objects . scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s , the craf and cassini missions are a collaborative project of nasa , the european space agency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy , as well as the united states air force and the department of energy . one day , space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials .  jupiter beyond mars and the asteroid belt , in the outer regions of our solar system , lie the giant planets of jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune . in 1972 , nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock . jupiter was the first port of call . pioneer 10 , which lifted off from kennedy space center in march 1972 , was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system . in december 1973 , it returned the first close up images of jupiter , flying within 132 , 252 kilometers 82 , 178 miles of the planet's banded cloud tops . pioneer 11 followed a year later . voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979 . these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium , topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium . ammonia ice crystals form white jovian clouds . sulfur compounds and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize jupiter's atmosphere . it is likely that methane , ammonia , water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below . because of jupiter's atmospheric dynamics , however , these organic compounds if they exist are probably short lived . the great red spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on earth . this hurricane like storm in jupiter's atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet . as a high pressure region , the great red spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low pressure storms on jupiter ; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it . the great red spot might be a million years old . our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiter's upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earth's northern lights at the jovian polar regions . voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint , narrow ring encircling jupiter . largest of the solar system's planets , jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds . the massive planet takes almost 12 earth years to complete a journey around the sun . with 16 known moons , jupiter is something of a miniature solar system . a new mission to jupiter the galileo project is under way . after a six year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once past venus , twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroids , the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to earth . the galileo orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to jupiter's large moons , exploring in detail what the two pioneers and two voyagers revealed .  galilean satellites in 1610 , galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet . for the first time , humans had seen the moons of another world . in honor of their discoverer , these four bodies would become known as the galilean satellites or moons . but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet sized satellites . one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io . volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than earth . the voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on io , with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers 175 miles above the moon's surface . io's pizza colored terrain , marked by orange and yellow hues , is probably the result of sulfur rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity . volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug of war between io , jupiter and the other three galilean moons . europa , approximately the same size as our moon , is the brightest galilean satellite . the moon's surface displays a complex array of streaks , indicating the crust has been fractured . caught in a gravitational tug of war like io , europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt apparently producing a liquid water ocean . this ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space . europa's core is made of rock that sank to its center . like europa , the other two galilean moons ganymede and callisto are worlds of ice and rock . ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system larger than the planets mercury and pluto . the satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock . ganymede's surface has areas of different brightness , indicating that , in the past , material oozed out of the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface . callisto , only slightly smaller than ganymede , has the lowest density of any galilean satellite , suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition . callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system ; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts . detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be performed by the galileo orbiter .  saturn no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn . its exquisite ring system is unrivaled . like jupiter , saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen . but in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in jovian clouds , saturn's atmosphere has a more subtle , butterscotch hue , and its markings are muted by high altitude haze . given saturn's somewhat placid looking appearance , scientists were surprised at the high velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1 , 770 kilometers 1 , 100 miles per hour . three american spacecraft have visited saturn . pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon titan in september 1979 , returning the first close up images . voyager 1 followed in november 1980 , sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of saturn's ring system and moons . voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in august 1981 . the rings are composed of countless low density particles orbiting individually around saturn's equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops . analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size , ranging from dust to house sized boulders . the rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock . the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to saturn . the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior . or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of saturn's gravity . a third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet . unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other , individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites . these complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings . radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager spacecraft . these emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from saturn's ring system rather than its atmosphere , where no lightning was observed . as they had at jupiter , the voyagers saw a version of earth's auroras near saturn's poles . the voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit . we learned that some moons shepherd ring particles , maintaining saturn's rings and the gaps in the rings . saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by voyager 2 in 1981 . voyager 1 determined that titan has a nitrogen based atmosphere with methane and argon one more like earth's in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and venus . titan's surface temperature of 179 degrees celsius 290 degrees fahrenheit implies that there might be water ice islands rising above oceans of ethane methane liquid or sludge . unfortunately , voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's dense clouds . continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting titan's methane to ethane , acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide . the latter compound is a building block of amino acids . these conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth between three and four billion years ago . however , titan's atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry . the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission . the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called huygens , which will be dropped into titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface . cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through titan's clouds and will spend years examining the saturnian system .  uranus in january 1986 , four and a half years after visiting saturn , voyager 2 completed the first close up survey of the uranian system . the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet's discovery over two centuries ago by the english astronomer william herschel . uranus , third largest of the planets , is an oddball of the solar system . unlike the other planets with the exception of pluto , this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84 year swing around the solar system . during voyager 2's flyby , the south pole faced the sun . uranus might have been knocked over when an earth sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system . voyager 2 found that uranus magnetic field does not follow the usual north south axis found on the other planets . instead , the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's center , a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta , on the island of java in indonesia . uranus atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen , with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia , methane and water vapor . the planet's blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors . wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers 360 miles per hour , and temperatures near the cloud tops average 221 degrees celsius 366 degrees fahrenheit . uranus sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene , ethane and other sunlight generated chemicals . surrounding the planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow . approximately 8 , 000 kilometers 5 , 000 miles below uranus cloud tops , there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10 , 000 kilometers 6 , 200 miles deep . beneath this ocean is an earth sized core of heavier materials . voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons , 16 169 kilometers 10 105 miles in diameter , orbiting uranus . the five previously known miranda , ariel , umbriel , titania and oberon range in size from 520 to 1 , 610 kilometers 323 to 1 , 000 miles across . representing a geological showcase , these five moons are half ice , half rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity , including faulting and ice flows . the most remarkable of uranus moons is miranda . its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons , crater pocked plains and winding valleys . the sharp variations in terrain suggest that , after the moon formed , it was smashed apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in our solar system , which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts . what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface . uranus was thought to have nine dark rings ; voyager 2 imaged 11 . in contrast to saturn's rings , which are composed of bright particles , uranus rings are primarily made up of dark , boulder sized chunks .  neptune voyager 2 completed its 12 year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet's moons . on august 25 , 1989 , the spacecraft swept to within 4 , 850 kilometers 3 , 010 miles of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton . during the neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's atmosphere was more active than uranus . voyager 2 observed the great dark spot , a circular storm the size of earth , in neptune's atmosphere . resembling jupiter's great red spot , the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1 , 200 kilometers 745 miles per hour . voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast moving cloud dubbed the scooter , as well as high altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck . the highest wind speeds of any planet were observed , up to 2 , 400 kilometers 1 , 500 miles per hour . like the other giant planets , neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior . the planet's core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants . neptune's distinctive blue appearance , like uranus blue color , is due to atmospheric methane . neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's spin axis and is not centered at the core . this phenomenon is similar to uranus magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores , where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal . earth's magnetic field , on the other hand , is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center . voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of neptune's rings . observations from earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet . it was not clear how neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even , unclumped rings . voyager 2 detected these arcs , but they were , in fact , part of thin , complete rings . a number of small moons could explain the arcs , but such bodies were not spotted . astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in 1846 and nereid in 1949 . voyager 2 found six more . one of the new moons proteus is actually larger than nereid , but since proteus orbits close to neptune , it was lost in the planet's glare for observers on earth . triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days . tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet . in 10 to 100 million years a short time in astronomical terms , the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart , forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet's modest current rings . triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of io and miranda . the moon has more rock than its counterparts at saturn and uranus . triton's mantle is probably composed of water ice , but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane . the moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain the so called cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap . dark streaks appear on the ice cap . these streaks are the fallout from geyser like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark , fine grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers 1 to 5 miles . triton's thin atmosphere , only 1 70 , 000th as thick as earth's , has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap the coldest surface yet found in the solar system 235 degrees celsius , 391 degrees fahrenheit . triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited .  pluto pluto is the most distant of the planets , yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside neptune's orbit , where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until march 1999 . pluto's orbit is also highly inclined tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets . discovered in 1930 , pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball . the planet's diameter is calculated to be approximately 2 , 300 kilometers 1 , 430 miles , only two thirds the size of our moon . ground based observations indicate that pluto's surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the sun . observations also show that pluto's spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees . the planet has one known satellite , charon , discovered in 1978 . charon's surface composition is different from pluto's the moon appears to be covered with water ice rather than methane ice . its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto , so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other . pluto's and charon's rotational period and charon's period of revolution are all 6 . 4 earth days . although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto , nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission .  comets the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets . as asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system , comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the sun . most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud , a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star . comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the sun . as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets , the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm ; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets , these volatile elements are boiling . the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across , and is made principally of water ice with methane and ammonia materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets . as these materials boil off of the nucleus , they form a coma or cloud like head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across . the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the sun . the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes on this cloud , blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet's tails . gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus , but dust particles are pushed more slowly . as the nucleus continues in its orbit , the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc . both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun ; in effect , the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun . the tails can reach 150 million kilometers 93 million miles in length , but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase . comets from the latin cometa , meaning long haired are essentially dramatic light shows . some comets pass through the solar system only once , but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets . these latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system . halley's comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet , returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus orbit . confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 b . c . this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley , because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return , based on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion . his name became part of astronomical lore when , in 1759 , the comet returned on schedule . unfortunately , sir edmond did not live to see it . a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to earth . unfortunately , on its most recent appearance , halley's comet passed no closer than 62 . 4 million kilometers 38 . 8 million miles from our world . the comet was visible to the naked eye , especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere , but it was not spectacular . comets have been so bright , on rare occasions , that they were visible during daytime . historically , comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky . the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun . craf will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails . several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed ; the first was nasa's international cometary explorer in 1985 . an armada of five spacecraft two japanese , two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency flew by halley's comet in 1986 .  conclusion despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere , scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely earth . but since 1959 , spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space . we have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years . our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets beyond our world except pluto ; they have observed moons as large as small planets , flown by comets and sampled the solar environment . astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations . we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects . the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology . by studying the geology of planets , moons , asteroids and comets , and comparing differences and similarities , we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole . we are also gaining insight into earth's complex weather systems. by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the sun's activity and its influence throughout the solar system , we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on earth . we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space . one current mission is mapping venus ; others are flying between worlds and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments . future missions are planned for mars , saturn , a comet and the asteroid belt . we can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world . although astronauts have not been back to the moon since december 1972 , plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian outposts . one day , taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony ! end

4			border	god	citizen	bank	perspective	engineer	right			 islam borders vs israeli borders   what are the borders the islamic world dreams about ?  the islamic world dreams of being the whole planet , but not by kicking the current inhabitant out , we rather deam of the day everybody converts . if jews had the same dream , i would not feel threatened a bit . contrary to what the protocols of zion crowd might suggest , judaism does not have any such goals . islamic readers , i am waiting to your honest answer .  i want also a honest answer from zionists for the following questions  1 why do jews who don not even believe in god as is the case with many of the founders of secular zionism have a right in palestine more than the inhabitants of palestine , just because god gave you the land ? the question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer . i am going to provide one from my own current perspective , not a historical one . currently , as a non observant jew israeli american , my own feeling is that jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in palestine or israel , than the palestinians or israelis both arab and jew do . with regard to jewish israelis , they should have the same rights in israel as do all other israelis . 2 why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel ? who are them ? if by them you mean the non religious jews , i think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious . the other part of the problem is , to my knowledge , not that the palestinians don not want to be a part of israel , as much as they would accept for the most part being full citizens of israel , with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded israeli citizens . what they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves .  shai guday stealth bombers , os software engineer thinking machines corporation the winged ninjas of the skies . cambridge , ma

2			team	cheer			 why is barry bonds not batting 4th ?  some folks like to argue about theoretical details . i prefer to watch teams win . when the giants slip to third , then we can talk about how to re arrange the batting order . until then , i think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong , for the simple fact that it's working as it is . this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division . but the giants are going to need every break they can get , if they want too hold that lead . i don not think they can afford to be lackadaisical , and say well it has worked pretty well so far , and while we might be able to improve the results , we don not think it is worth the risk . mostly , though , the giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that continues , it's rather silly to second guess their strategy . but evidently , some folks would rather be right than be first the two tend to go hand in hand . cheers , valentine
3			condition	patient			 post polio syndrome information needed please ! dn briefly , this is a condition in which patients who have significant dn residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the dn weakness as they get older . one theory is that the remaining motor dn neurons have to work harder and so die sooner . if this theory were true , the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units ; it doesn not . instead , the biopsy shows scattered , angulated , atrophic fibers . this is more consistent with load shedding by chronically overworked motor neurons the neurons survive , at the expense of increasingly denervated muscle .  . slmr 2 . 1 . email jim zisfein

3			condition	procedure	aid	cross	patient	player	technique	chip	doctor	infection	disease	medicine	fool			 info colonics and purification ? recently i have come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition .  no doubt the sci . med folks are getting out their flamethrowers . i m rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in the accepted academic scientific journals . so , the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that .  also , insofar as it doesn not conform to the accepted medical presumption that it just doesn not matter what you eat , and that we can think of the gi tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong except for maybe cancer and ulcers , the righteous will no doubt jump on that too .  then there will be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack , even though he , like linus pauling , is lucid and robust well into his nineties but nevermind about that . he shouldn not charge for his equipment and supplies , since they are no doubt not approved by the fda . of course , with fda approval an md or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as thalidomide . but nevermind about that either .  unfortunately , you dared to step into the sacred turf of net . medical . discussion without a credential and without understanding that the righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced before dismissing you as a fool .  but maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will send you some reasonable responses by email .  1 2 ;  1 2 ;  oh yes , i did have a point . a few years ago an md with a thriving practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommended that i take such treatments to clear up a skin condition . not through his office , i might add . although i m sure that's not conclusive , it was sure an unusual prescription !  the bacteria in your gut are important . but colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function . each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his her gut . diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics . a diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes . cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this treatment since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient treatments . dental drills have me a little concerned about hiv infection and i have picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments more clostly but much safer . full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an or mask , gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients . each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so i have to pay it out of pocket . his much higher fees do not drive away patients . i can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure . for very little , if any benefit , you subject yourself to hepatitis , cholera , parasitic disease and even hiv . just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment ? could they be having gi distress ? could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism ? could i get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients ? do i really want to take this risk ? food for thought . marty b .

3			explanation	session	telephone	space	algorithm	procedure	escrow	communication	conversation	clipper	wiretap	agency	key	chip			 some questions was revised summary here is a revised version of my summary that corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation . thank you very much . after reading the text some distinct questions arised to me , which i guess will also be asked by other people . perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ? the clipper chip a technical summary n , a 30 bit serial number this length is subject to change shorter or longer ? once the session key k is established , the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitized voice . the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values e m ; k , the encrypted message stream , and e e k ; u n ; f , a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line . the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n , all encrypted under the family key f . the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed . first question when will the lawenforcmentfield be transmitted , and how does the remote clipper chip handle it ? is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks , or just at the beginning ? does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever , or tries it to turn them into voice output ? which would not be disturbing at the beginning of a session , a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault . agent 1 enters a secret , random 80 bit value s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret , random 80 bit value s2 . these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers . thus , the unit keys are a function of 160 secret , random bits , where each agent knows only 80 . second question why ! ! why is such a strange procedure used , and not a real rng ? this turns those s1 , s2 in a kind of bottleneck for system security . when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line , they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line . let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the clipper chip . the law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key f , giving e k ; u n . documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number n is then sent e.g . via secure fax to each of the key escrow agents , who return e.g . also via secure fax u1 and u2 . u1 and u2 are xored together to produce the unit key u , and e k ; u is decrypted to get the session key k . finally the message stream is decrypted . all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder . so no technical provision will be taken to place a not imeout on these warrants ? this would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction , by letting the escrow agencies perform the decoding of the a bad idea ? a successor to the clipper chip , called capstone by the government and myk 80 by mykotronx , has already been developed . it will include the skipjack algorithm , the digital signature standard dss , the secure hash algorithm sha , a method of key exchange , a fast exponentiator , and a randomizer . a prototoype will be available for testing on april 22 , and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in june or july . wow ! how does the randomizer work ? are the sha and key exchange secret , or publicly known ? key exchange is dh , i guess ? it seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time , your government realy means to act . friendly greetings , germano caronni  instruments register only through things they are designed to register . space still contains infinite unknowns . pgp key id 341027 germano caronni fd560ccf586f3da747ea3c94dd01720f

3			ibm	patient	state			 how to diagnose lyme . really disclaimer this posting represents the poster's views , not necessarily those of ibm .   now , i m not saying that culturing is the best way to diagnose ; it's very hard to culture bb in most cases . the point is that dr. n has developed a feel for what is and what isn not ld . this comes from years of experience . no serology can match that . unfortunately , some would call dr. n a quack and accuse him of trying to make a quick buck .  why do you think he would be called a quack ? the quacks don not do cultures . they poo poo doing more lab tests this is lyme , believe me , i have seen it many times . the lab tests aren not accurate . we will treat it now . also , is dr. n's practice almost exclusively devoted to treating lyme patients ? i don not know any orthopedic surgeons who fit this pattern . they are usually gps .   are you arguing that the lyme lab test is accurate ? the books that i have read say that in general the tests have a 50 50 chance of being correct . the tests result in a large number of both false positives and false negatives . i am in the latter case . we could get those same odds by rolling the dice .  ralph yozzo from the beautiful and historic new york state mid hudson valley .
2			mph	car	engineer			 best radar detector valentine 1 ?  let me explain why i feel the bogey counter feature is a gimmick . radar waves bounce off objects especially metal . that is how radar speed measurement works . a high frequency microwave x band approx 10 ghz and k is approx 24 ghz is sent out and reflected back to the antenna off of an automobile or other objects . if an object is moving a doppler shift about 34 hz per mph on x band occurs , is measured and converted to miles per hour . these waves bounce all over the place and they can reflect many times and go in many directions .  from what i understand the valentine 1 can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front , rear or both . there are only two antennas . if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey . bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source .  i m certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument , but don not you answer your own question ? is the reflected signal shifted at all from the act of being reflected ? if so , wouldn not it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources ? here is the problem . since the microwaves reflect , how does the unit tell if it is a source or a reflection ? take a valentine 1 and drive to the local grocery store that uses an x band radar door opener . you can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a 45 degree angle and your detector going off when it gets near . the valentine 1 will count 7 or 8 bogeys from all directions front , rear and sides it doesn not say which side . the count changes as cars drive by and reflections change . is there 7 or 8 sources ? not at the store i go to . as i drive around with a standard detector i can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front door .  troy wecker  sequent computer systems beaverton , or  david w . hwang , m . d .

1			directory	space	configuration	file	right	scheme	windows			 colorado jumbo 250 for gateway 2000 ? i have just installed a new colorado jumbo 250 tape backup unit from gateway , and i have a couple of complaints with it . i don not know how common or serious these problems may be . i would appreciate some feedback from others who have used this system . btw , this is on a 4dx2 66v tower system . i have a similar configuration colorado 250mb on 66 dx 2 tower . the problems are o firstly , gateway shipped me only 120 mb tapes , even though the drive is a 250 mb unit . when i called to complain , they only said that's all we carry , and with compression , you can fit 250 mb on one tape . maybe so , but then why did i pay extra for the large capacity tape drive ? you got suckered in the same way i did . silly me , believing that the 250 logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity . the people who do this sort of thing for a living call it marketing . lawyers who prosecute it call it fraud . perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on their corporate headquarters . o i have about 230 mb of data on my c drive . i choose the space optimizing compression scheme and started a full backup . the software estimated it would take about 22 minutes . it took 4 1 2 hours . does this sound about right ? this is a bit long . my system takes about 45 minutes to do the same thing . usually 4 . 5 hours , particularly if the tape is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for the write is too small . is there any way to change the block size or write buffer size so it's bigger ? o during the backup , about a dozen files came up with access denied errors . most of these were in c windows system comm . drv , keyboarddrv , shell . dll , etc . but also c windows progman . exe and a couple of files in the c tape directory . anyone else had this happen ? this is because the files are opened by dos . the files in the tape directory are likely the executable file or the configuration file for the tape system . i would recommend running the backup from dos so it will make a complete backup of the tape directory . thanks for any and all feedback on this system . i would also appreciate hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges , preferably 250 mb size . the 250mb cartridges won not do you any good since the drive won not write 250mb of physical data on the tape . thanks . pd  brent williams san jose , california
5			god	christian	cheer	atheism	existence	state	fallacy	understanding	atheist	faith	theist	nature			 why do people become atheists ? a lot of stuff deleted i m focusing on just one point well , he got me there . i am a strong atheist , because i feel that lack of evidence , especially about something like an omnipotent being , implies lack of existence . however , i haven not met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him . call me a seeker if you like , i don not . weak atheism is being ignore here , though . some atheists simply say i don not believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no god s exist for the weak atheist , the is no atheism to disbelieve , because they don not actively believe in atheism . if you think this is confusing , try figuring out the difference between protestants and methodists from an atheist point of view . i m a little confused about the difference between this weak atheism , as you put it , and agnosticism . is agnosticism not believing or necessarily disbelieving in anything , or what is it ? i used to be agnostic by this definition but if weak atheism includes not necessarily believing in god , then i guess i was one of those . actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not ever decide what they believe . i am constantly in a state of self examination , as it would appear many others are as well including the atheists , of course i would assume that's why they are here ! i guess some people don not really consider it important to think about the answers to life , the universe and everything any comment ? just wondering . this is another fallacy many theists seem to have , that everyone believes in something followed up by everyone has faith in something . guess what ? my atheism ends the moment i m shown a proof of some god's existence . is that really too much to ask ? tough call , as these things seem to be based on faith wish i could help you , but i already tried once with someone who was a self professed agnostic thinking of becoming a christian , and it didn not work too well ! especially tough as i m still mulling over whether or not i believe in miracles looks like another email to my chaplain is coming up . all i can do is wish you the best of luck , and please do post what you find . and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest note that i can only speak for myself . if you find faith to be honest , show me how . hmm , how so ? i guess i really don not understand . there are times , of course , when i say to myself of course i have absolutely no way of knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and sense of peace i get from it which of course could just be psychological . somehow i live with this anyway is this what you mean ? the only proof i have is that i believe god spoke to me once which could of course be my own imagination . the odd thing is , though , that if you don not at some point start believing in something , after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous . maybe it's just a question of where you draw the line . i have been unable to reconcile it so far . maybe that's how i m broken ? i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it . if you accept that , you are of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think . all i ask for is proof of the assertion god exists . logical or physical proofs only , please . then we will discuss the nature of god . i will only add one question have you read pascal ? what did you think of him if you did ? also you may or may not be interested by cslewis surprised by joy . i would be interested in knowing what you think of him , no sarcasm at all intended . i just say this because one can never know how one's written words will be interpreted . i am not interested in converting you , since i don not seem to have whatever it would take proof to do so . i m just interested in learning . muppets and garlic toast forever , i like this . max bob muir cheers , vera  i give you everything disclaimer of course i don not agree with my sweet everything trent reznor's nin's theology . i think nine inch nails it's interesting nonetheless . vera noyes

5			truth	notion	god	understanding	mr.	context	religion	concept			 rawlins debunks creationism we are talking about origins , not merely science . science cannot explain origins . for a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science . this is a false premise . by the way , i enjoy science . it is truly a wonder observing god's creation . macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion guaranteed within three percent error let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point , sentence by sentence . 1 we are talking about origins , not merely science . origins of what ? are we speaking of the origins of life , the human species , the universe , physical law , biological diversity or what ? 2 science cannot explain origins . this is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified . it depends on what origins we are talking about . 3 for a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science . again , this is a false statement . to begin with , the notion of higher truth is distinctly dubious . many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science ; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain . many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science . let it be so . these truths are neither higher or lower ; they are simply true . more to the point , restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge ; it simply restricts the scope of discussion . 4 this is a false premise . if this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then 4 is actually true . however the context identifies it as another false or at least theologically unsound statement . 5 by the way , i enjoy science . on the evidence mr. rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense . one might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read . however one cannot mark this sentence as false to follow the analogy , perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters . 6 it is truly a wonder observing god's creation . let us not quibble ; count this one as true . 7 macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion guaranteed within three percent error still another false statement . however one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification macroevolution , as misunderstood by rawline , is a mixture of 15 percent of what rawlins erroneously thinks of as science , and 85 percent of what rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion .  it is distinctly noticeable that mr. rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels . i do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions . one can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth .  richard harter smds incorporation net address phone 508 369 7398 us mail smds incorporation , po box 555 , concord ma 01742 . fax 508 369 8272 in the fields of hell where the grass grows high are the graves of dreams allowed to die .

4			war	lord	street	amendment	price	scheme	symptom	victim	television	violation	crime	shooting	weapon	abuse	country	link	violence	disease	right	proposal	sale			 drugs and crime a new approach mark wilson writes , missing the entire point of my post  given that  1 . the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation .  there is much evidence that it is the fact that the drugs are illegal , not the drugs themselves that have caused the violence . witness prohibition and the violence that surrounded the trade in alcohol . no joke . 2 . people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get them , whether or not they are legally available .  this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal ? no , you jumped to that conclusion . it's actually an argument as to how to accomplish the societal good of discouraging drug use without violating individual rights . 3 . despite current law enforcement efforts , drugs are readily available to those who want them .  this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal ? no. you missed the point . the point is , the war on drugs is a failure , and is counterproductive . 4 . addiction to drugs , boh legal and illegal , is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country , and this occurs in a variety of ways , from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable to learn , to the spread of disease among addicts , to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking .  the crack baby scenario has been thouroughly discredited . it just so happens that the symptoms seen in the crack babies are identical to fetal alcohol syndrome . and the mothers who admitted to taking crack also admitted to drinking heavily during pregnancy .  in this country people are free to be stupid if they want to . but , they are not free to be stupid and injure other people . admittedly , the fetal right to life is outside the scope of this discussion . however , it's ridiculous to assert , as you apparently do , that cocaine has no effect on the developing fetal nervous system . caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects too , why should cocaine be any exception ? 5 . a general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of , and whatever is taxed you get less of . to be most effective in confronting the nation's drug problem , some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive .  so make the drugs legal , tax them and use the tax money to fund a program to tell people how studid drugs are . it has worked for the legal drugs . if you had read my article before writing your knee jerk response you would have seen that this is exactly what i advocated . while this country's current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects , there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking , and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving , for example , the same cannot be said for the war on illegal drugs . there remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers , pushers , growers , processors , kingpins , and gangsters . these networks and their marketing activities , which include drive by shootings , corrupting law enforcement authorities , and smuggling weapons , are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day .  each and every one of these problems is a direct result of the drug trade being illegal . no shit , sherlock . . clearly , illegal drugs and rising crime are linked . it takes only a moment's reflection to recognize how they are linked . the link is money . as with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption , a black market has been created , in which greedy local monopolies , like the gangsters of a bygone era , have profited enormously from their illegal trade . the victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire , but , i would argue , the drug users themselves .  a great argument for making drugs legal . thank you . how could you have missed the point so utterly ? what have you been smoking ? here then is my proposal  1 . possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized , but buying and selling them remains illegal . potheads can grow their own marijuana as many already do today , other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs , and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops .  your solution has done nothing to eliminate the violence in the drug trade . btw , how is someone going to import a drug if buying it is illegal . i think you need to think your solution through a little more thouroughly . obviously , importers will not be buying drugs in the u.s . under u.s. jurisdiction . use your remaining brain cells . 2 . because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users , the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle . if these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing , why buy them ? nevertheless , there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively low prices . therefore ,  you have failed to indicate how these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing . you have stated that the sale of them is illegal . o . k . i will spell it out for you . barter economy means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose , or to buy it outside the u.s. and bring it in , if it won not grow here . they will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture . they will not , however be able to legally sell their drugs for money . both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed , to discourage their use . this is your brain on drugs . any questions ? 3 . law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell , and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices . but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers , the victimizers , and the drug users , their victims.  in most cities , this is already the strategy . it has already failed and is dragging the rest of us down with it . pardon me , but possession use of these drugs is still a crime ! you cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek treatment , and the comparative ease with which it could be made available today , when these drugs are illegal to possess use , with what it would be were they not illegal to possess use . decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment much easier . drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who are prone to addiction , and as such , the drug users should be left alone , not thrown in prison along with their victimizers . drug dealers are the criminals , and should be treated as such . drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your criminal actions , however . 4 . upon arrest for any crime , suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of , if they are found to be a drug user , they will be institutionalized until they are clean , and only then will they begin to serve their sentence . if they choose to cooperate and are already drug free , they can begin to serve their sentence right away . those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences .  this sounds a hell of a lot like self incrimination . which is unconstitutional . if drug use is legal in your scheme , why should the presence of drugs in anyones system influence the penalty they receive ? much too big brotherish for my tastes . the drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary , not coerced , and does not therefore constitute violation of amendment v . those convicted who are drug users , as evidenced by the test , are in need of treatment for their problem . institutionalization of these adddicted criminals is , i would argue , the best way to help them straighten out . if they refuse the test and are convicted , their sentence can be appropriately harsher , since they , unlike the addict , have no excuse for their crimes . 5 . institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes  drug using criminals and this includes drunk and or 'stoned drivers are separated from their sources of supply , thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large , and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street , putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business .  why should drug using criminals be treated any different from other criminals , you have already stated that drug use is legal .   why not ? my objective is to discourage drug use and criminal behavior . if fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a harsher sentence if they are convicted , why is that not a good thing ? if fewer drug dealers who are still criminals , btw can find victims , why is that not a good thing ? if fewer drug users , such as drunks , potheads , etc . commit crimes out of fear of being cut off from their sources of supply , why is that not a good thing ? i m certainly willing to debate my position . you have to read it carefully though . standard disclaimer . x , dna ken barnes , lifesci bldg . conservative libertarians for pro balance ! memphis , tn i find television very educating . every time somebody turns on the set , i go into the other room and read a book . groucho marx
5			homosexuality	sin	christian	gospel	jesus	bible			 part 1 and part 2 re homosexuality  why don not we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away ?  certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from jesus . but we shouldn not water down the gospel to draw people in . very well put . and , in the case of someone who calls himself a christian brother yet continues in his sin and claims that his sin is not a sin at all , but perfectly acceptable , what should be done ? should christians just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person ? by reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the bible , are they using a bullwhip to drive people from jesus ? frankly , i find the occurance of a homosexual christian attempting to pass himself off as a 'straight christian in order to have other christians accept his chastisement better a lot more serious than people reaffirming that the bible teaches homosexuality is a sin . walter

3			engineer	nature			 digital voltmeter how does it work ? hello ,  let me introduce a problem  when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter , using ac mode , my output is an rms value a peak value over 2 squared . right ? when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac , my output is equal to a peak value , actually , to the upper flat boundary of the wave . i assumed , that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value , and divides it over the wave period . right ? now , i used it to measure the same square wave as above , but distorted by high frequency harmonics . ideally , output should be the same , but . the output value was only about 10 of the previous one ! why ? what is the nature of this output value ? what does the voltmeter actually measure ? and what does it show ? re rms readings unless the dvm says it's measuring rms , it's probably average voltage . the input is diode rectified and measured as dc . if it says it's rms and but measures square triangle etc. incorrectly , it's measuring average and multipling by a correction that's only true for sine waves i.e. vave 0 . 707 0 . 63 vrms . if you want correct rms for most any waveform , you need a true rms dvm dmm which literally does the root mean square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry .  related question less important to me what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones ? the last significant advantage of analog imo was being able to see the signal if it was changing over time e.g. checking electrolytic capacitors . anymore , most dmm have bargraphs , etc. that duplicate this .  thank you for your attention , you could mail me your opinion at or open a discussion here . i would appreciate either way .   alexander v . mamishev   power system automation laboratory phone office 409 845 4623 department of electrical engineering phone home 409 846 5850 texas a&m university fax 409 862 2282 college station , tx 77843 , usa internet     jeff gruszynski semiconductor test equipment systems engineer hewlett packard  415 or t 694 3381

1			apple	telephone	spirit	wire	mac	soul			 updated keyboard question for the plus i have an old mac plus . a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc . it came with apple's new keyboard with abd ports . i replaced it with a mac pro plus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy , thank you very much .  well , i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem . the plus uses an rj 11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don not . i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer they are such nice people , but they couldn not tell me the order of the wires .  there are four wires in the adb cables black , white , red , tan . i know one's a ground , one gets the serial signal , one supplies 5 volts , and i forgot what the fourth one does . anyway , if you hook them up wrong you will fry a board and i really don not want to do that .  if any brave souls out there have done this before , please email your experience directly to me . i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . ergonomically correct .  btw , i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj 11 jack and the adb since it has both , but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of little boxes . oh , well .  one more thing in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus you are right . however , you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac pro plus keyboard via its own rj 11 jack . in other words , this little engineering feat i wish to do is possible . it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order .  omt , when i get this to work , i definitely will post the solution so others can , too . thanx for the input .   tis the blink of an eye , tis the draught of a breath , from the blossoms of health , to the paleness of death , from the gilded saloon , to the briar in the shroud , o , why should the spirit of mortal be proud ? william knox

1			scene	isa	polygon	windows	improvement	graphics	vlb	file	resolution	chip	pixel	cross	screen	microsoft	bitmap	unix	font			 orchid p9000 vs fahrenheit mini review in going with the modern trend , the orchid p9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver . of course , this breaks any dos program which uses svga modes like most of my cd roms . this is not the case the rom on the p9000 supports vesa modes of up to 1024x768 in 256 colors . vesa compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes . but i m forwarding your posting to our software group , just in case . can not be too careful . not that i doubt that your applications are failing to run ; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact svga they are looking at , and don not use vesa calls vesa is still pretty new . every new chip set confuses them . the supported resolutions really annoy me . you can do 1280x1024 at 75hz if you tell the driver you have an nec 5fg they only have about six monitors listed plus generic , and if you choose generic you can not get any high refreshes at all . but at 1024x768 you are limited to 70hz . seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do 75hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024 ! higher vertical resolution was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f . vlb i currently have , and it will do 1024x768x70 hz as well . i think we go to at least 76 hz at 1024x768x8 , and maybe more and it's a function of the ramdac speed , not the power 9000 . we need to fix the problems you have noted they were already on the list . if you are really interested , though , take a look at the text file p9000res . dat , which holds the data from which the choices in the p9000 monitor installation program are built . working by analogy , you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors . keep a backup copy of the file ! once you have built a new version of the p9000res . dat file , run the p9000 installation program , inst , and your new choices should show up . this assumes you have the weitek v . 2 . 2 drivers . you can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver 02 20 is version 2 . 20 . microsoft uses this gimmick , too . the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules speedy program . this program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels second . i don not have the numbers for the graphite card , but they were close to half of the ofvlb ie , slower but that was running in a 20mhz 386 , isa , so the numbers aren not really comparable . the following numbers were all obtained using a 486 , 33 mhz , air motherboard umc chipset , with 8 mb memory . i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them , and these tend to jump around a bit . the speedy benchmark was put out by hercules and iit , who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the hercules graphite iit agx014 card look really good . so i would take the numbers with a ton of salt . texas instruments did the same thing with wintach , trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514 , as if anyone cared . it's safer though not safe to use benchmarks from unbiased sources , such as testing labs , columnists , etc. interestingly , the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement , and hatched polygons ie , filled with cross hatching and ternary rops whatever they are . graphics operations like xors maybe ? are a dead loss on the 9000 . i think you will a large discrepancy between the results of speedy and the results of anything else in the universe on these things . i give two numbers for the 9000 fonts , because i think they are caching . when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly 1 3 the speed of the ofvlb . then the speed increases dramatically . sounds like programming to a benchmark to me . font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization windows has hooks for it built right into the gdi . what's kind of silly is iit's use of a hardwired the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver . not only is it useless in real applications , it lacks the programming elegance of the bart simpson optimization , in which you save the bitmap of the most recently drawn string in off screen memory , and just do a screen to screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row . we call it the bart simpson optimization because bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it he could right i will not cheat on benchmarks a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character . i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all . its just what i saw when i ran them on my computer . i normally don not write disclaimers , but this time maybe i would better . my testing is totally unconnected with my work i program under unix on decstations is done completely without the knowledge , blessing , or equipment of my company . we don not have any lawyers they are all working for intel . there used to be a lawyer in montana who didn not , but he died . robert  robert plamondon , pay no attention to the man behind the curtain . i , the great and glorious oz , have spoken ! scene from a trade show

3			country	disease	patient	medicine	bank	doctor	arm	kidney			 morbus meniere is there a real remedy ?   my biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like most people with dizziness can be cured . that's definitely not the case . in most cases , like i said above , it is a long , tedious process that may or may not end up in a partial cure .   be sure to say chronic dizziness , not just dizziness . most patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better . the vertiginous spells of meniere's will also eventually go away , however , the patient is left with a deaf ear . all true . and all good points .  to anyone suffering with vertigo , dizziness , or any variation thereof , my best advice to you as a fellow sufferer is this . just keep searching . don not let the doctors tell you there's nothing that can be done . do your own research . and let your  this may have helped you , but i m not sure it is good general advice . the odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim . when good answers to these then , spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive things in life . a limited amount should be spent to assure yourself that your doctor gave you the correct story , but after it becomes clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine has no good solution , perhaps the best strategy is to join the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to make a career out of it . well , making a career out of it is a bit strong . i still believe that doing your own research is very , very necessary . i would not have progressed as much as i have today , unless i had spent the many hours in stanford's med library as i have done . and 5 years ago , it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me . so should i have stopped searching . thank goodness i didn not . now i found that there is indeed medicine that helps me . i think that what you have said is kind of idealistic . that you would go to one doctor , get a diagnosis , maybe get a second opinion , and then move on with your life . just as an example . having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country , i have received 6 different diagnoses . these are the top names , the ones that people come to from all over the country . i have had to sort all of this out myself . going to a support group and in fact , heading that support group was helpful for a while , but after a point , i found it very unproductive . it was much more productive to do library research , make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself . a recent movie , lorenzo's oil , offers a perfect example of what i m talking about . if you haven not seen it , you should . it's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what i m saying . doctors are only human and can only do so much . but there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed . i guess i m biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown . if i had a broken arm , or a weak heart , or failing kidneys , i might not have the same opinion . that's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments . with dizziness , you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it . i have chosen the latter . linda    gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect , and it is shameful to surrender it too soon .

4			country	scheme	procedure	medicine			 malpractice not the issue was re 8 myths about national health . malpractice insurance and litigation don not explain us health probs the difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees .  lack of defensive medicine and near absence of malpractice is really  why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance   then why do we really need national health insurance then ? wouldn not it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance ? it would if malpractice and defensive medicine were the main factors in explaining spiralling us health care costs , but they aren not . although gary is correct in noting that malpractice related problems are greater in the us than canada , they by no means account for the overall difference in health care costs . they do account for a somewhat larger portion of the difference in physicians gross income in the two countries . some facts . malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1 of total health care costs in the us . in 1991 , according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged paying 3 . 7 of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance . malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985 ; they have declined significantly since then . at the same time , health care costs have increased more than any period in history . as far as defensive medicine is concerned , the ama estimates that its total impact is about $ 7 billion per year . that's about 8 of the total current increase in health care costs and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health care . as small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things , however , clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification of md's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their specialties . this would eliminate most , if not all frivolous suits while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice . jsh  steve hendricks domain one thing about data , it sure does cut uucp . uunet ! isc br ! thor ! steveh the bulls t . r . hofferbert ma bell 509 838 8826

5			theist	christian	violence	being	murder	fallacy	logic	nature	fool	atheism	existence	atheist	god	belief	religion	russian			 amusing atheists and agnostics atheism denies the existence of god . this is logically bankrupt where is the proof of this nonexistence ? it's a joke . this is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i.e. the belief that you can not deny anything that you can not prove doesn not exist this is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist , does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them ? according to the above poster , we must believe in objects or beings that haven not been proved not to exist so why stop at god ? there could be a huge number of beings identical to ronald reagan except for trivial differences , say one is missing a finger , one has blond hair , and they all live on other planets so we can not see them the reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of god . fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of a god ? here again is a classic atheist fallacy . how did they shoot themselves in the foot ? radical muslims , the crusades , the inquisition are common examples that atheists like to bring up as marks against religion . how weak ! only fools can take that drivel seriously . how about the grand daddy of all human atrocities , the stalinist movement ? twenty eight million people killed under this leadership , which proudly featured atheism . there is a big difference here , stalin didn not say that he stood for a particular moral position i.e. against murder and terrorism , etc. and then did the opposite like the religious movements , he was at least an honest killer . this is not a support of stalin but an attack on this viewpoint . saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic , look at all the russians that helped stalin that weren not atheists don not they contradict your point ? besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people , this is just the common assumption that atheists can not value life as much as theists which you didn not support . agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable . yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of god is unknowable . this in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is , though it's less arrogant and pompous . ah , and here's another point you didn not get out of the faq . an atheist doesn not have to hold the positive view that god doesn not exist , he she may just have the non existence of the positive belief . here's the example  strong atheism i believe god does not exist a positive belief weak atheism i don not believe in a god a negative belief  these are not the same , some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist , but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable . or let's look at it this way in sets  suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that i will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not . so if s santa , then e s no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa . but notice that even e s no is itself another idea ! this means you have lots of cases  christian a , e a yes , b , e b no , . g , e g yes . where g god  atheist strong a , e a . . g , e g no  atheist weak a , e i.e. no g at all in the set  agnostic a , g , e g indeterminate , e , why are people so afraid to say undecided ? it must just be another feature of human nature undecided is not a sexy , trendy , or glamorous word it does not inspire much hate or conflict . it's not blasphemous . it's not political . in fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated . nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival trait , evolution has drilled it in us to take positions , even false ones . bake timmons , iii m . s .

5			army	truth	jesus	christianity	peter	country	faith	existence	scheme	arrogance	lord	officer	god	soldier	scripture	troop	fallacy	matthew	salvation	testament			 is it good that jesus died ? brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter , or we must discount every other book of antiquity 1 peter died two millenia ago . the original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust if he were alive today and i could  do you question the existence of alexander the great , tilgrath pilisar iii , nero , caligula , josephus , cyrus the great , artexerxes ? their documents have decayed to dust too . brian , why another excuse ? mr ceccarelli , you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every historical document . somehow i doubt do that yourself that . thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document , i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter . i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity , which i am sure you reject ; it dates from the time of ramses ii this was first presented here by matthew wiener . these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle , and were carved with the pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals , rather than mere copies . this account records the the battle of kadesh circa 1285 bc , which occurred on the river orontes , about 100 miles south of aleppo . the egyptians won this battle with the hittites , and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place . a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form . it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single handedly defeated the hittites , after being separated from his troops . note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person . the following is from miriam lichtheim s ancient egyptian literature volume ii . my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall on their faces , one upon the other , as crocodiles fall , into the water of the orontes . i was after them like a griffin ; i attacked all the countries , i alone . for my infantry and my chariotry had deserted me ; not one of them stood looking back . as i live , as ra loves me , as my father atum favors me , everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth , in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry . note this paragraph records not only ramses divine word , but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event . now from the heart of battle . then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces of the foe from hitti , being alone by himself , none other with him . his majesty proceeded to look about him and found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out . no officer was with me , no charioteer , no soldier of the army , no shield bearer ; my infantry , my chariotry yielded before them , not one of them stood firm to fight with them . his majesty spoke what is this , father amun ? is it right for a father to ignore his son ? are my deeds a matter for you to ignore ? do i not walk and stand at your word ? i have not neglected an order you gave . too great is he , the great lord of egypt , to allow aliens to step on his path ! what are these asiatics to you , o amun , the wretches ignorant of god ? have i not made for you many great monuments , . i call to you , my father amun , i am among a host of strangers ; all countries are arrayed against me , i am alone , there's none with me ! . the labors of many people are nothing , amun is more helpful than they ; i came here by the command of your mouth , o amun , i have not transgressed your command ! now though i prayed in a distant land , my voice resounded in southern thebes . i found amun came when i called to him , he gave me his hand and i rejoiced . he called from behind as if near by forward , i am with you , i your father , my hand is with you , i prevail over a hundred thousand men , i am lord of victory , lover of valor ! i found my heart stout , my breast in joy , all i did succeeded , i was like mont . . i slaughtered among them at my will , not one looked behind him , not one turned around , whoever fell down did not rise . . one called out to the other saying no man is he who is among us , it is seth great of strength , baal in person ; not deeds of man are these his doings , they are of one who is unique , who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots , come quick , flee before him , to seek life and breathe air ; for he who attempts to get close to him , his hands , all his limbs grow limp . one cannot hold either bow or spears , when one sees him come racing along ! my majesty hunted them like a griffin , i slaughtered among them unceasingly . so you see brian , we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the ramses and the hittites . do you reject them as being completely true ? i suspect you do , and if so , then do you also , in your own words question the existence of alexander the great , tilgrath pilisar iii , nero , caligula , josephus , cyrus the great , artexerxes ? do you also thereby question all their documents ? that s the problem with your all or nothing approach . many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts . so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no records of antiquity at all , forces you thereby , to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible . as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus , that he must be true are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness ? are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer programmers , fiction ? with a scoff of your keyboard , with near complete ignorance of the testimonies , are you going to say that that is all complete hooey ? would that not be the most audacious display of arrogance ? do you actually think you know better than king solomon , king david , or even abraham lincoln ?  i have three points . first , this is argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion ; you cannot vote on truth . for instance , do the millions of hindu's past and present who testify to the reality of brahma , constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma ? how would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of hindus with a scoff of your keyboard , with near complete ignorance of the testimonies , are you going to say that that is all complete hooey ? if you do so scoff , then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading ? second , it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to jesus . you can claim it to be clear , but that does not make it true . third , it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian , and that he had both a public and a private view of christianity . in fact there was much discussion about it in his day yes , he was publically accused of being a deist oh my . i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as i have previously done for tyre , jefferson and etc.  later , dave butler my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures , have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for thinking i shall ever change them . abraham lincoln to judge j s wakefield after the death of willie lincoln .

3			existence	mechanism	right	tradition	logic			 science and methodology was homeopathy . tradition ?   i don not think extra scientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science , except as a proposed definiens . extra rational is a better phrase . in fact , there are quite a number of well known cases of extra rational considerations driving science in a useful direction .  yeah , but the problem with holding up the extra rational examples as exemplars , or as refutations of well founded methodology , is that you run smack up against such unuseful directions as lysenko . such extra rational cases are curiosities not guides to methodology . as has been noted before , there is the distinction between motivation and method . no experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated , and the replications do indeed reproduce the result . no theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed , and reasonable , knowlegeable , people agree with the force of the logic . but people try experiments , and pursue arguments , for all sorts of crazy reasons . irrational motivations are not just curiousities ; they are a large part of the history of science . there are a couple of negative points to make here 1 a theory of qi could , conceivably , become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi . for example , quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics , with no direct verification . what would be needed would be a theory , based on qi , that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives . the central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment , as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other . i wouldn not hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi , though . i don not think that there is even a coherent theory based on it , much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology . and it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi . 2 science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment data theory sequence . most experiments are carried out , and interpreted , in pre existing theoretical frameworks . the theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done . overall , there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies , crazy motivations , petty hatreds , and the like that determines which experiments , and which computations , get done . what keeps it going forward is the critical function of science results don not count unless they can be replicated . the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate and test the generate part can be totally irrational , as long as the test part works properly . pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals ; but even mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed ; that when you separate them by handedness , you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions ; and the right rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid . pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable , and important , result . this is where lysenko , creationists , etc. fail . they have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything . when their theories do predict , and are contradicted by experiment , they do not concede the point and modify their theories ; rather they try to suppress the results lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position creationists .  mark a . fulk university of rochester computer science department

3			cryptography	proposal	country	clipper	chip	concern	right	algorithm	communication	technique	privacy	education	arrogance	meaning	file	announcement	encryption			 text of white house announcement and q&as on clipper chip encryption the key question is whether non clipper encryption will be made illegal .  the administration is not saying , since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done ; nor is the u.s. saying that every does anyone know what countries are these ? american , as a matter of right , is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product . there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition . rather , both concerns can be , and in fact are , harmoniously balanced through a reasoned , balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques .  the clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that americans have the right to clipper encryption , but not to unbreakable encryption . this implies that , ultimately , non clipper strong encryption must become illegal . with the following logical consequences a using any code designed to obscure informatio which is not easily breakable will be illegal , including i using code words such as project p5 ii speaking a language other than english iii ever refering implicitly to events not known to everyone , eg hi john . how was last night ? for all the listener knows , this may be a code for did you pick up the drugs ok last night ? of be a code for ok . we blow up the pentagon at midnight . iv mentioning anything that could not be perfectly understood by an average person with no education . v words with more than one syllable . vi speaking with a heavy accent that could bemisunderstood by people not used to it . vii books with an inner meaning . such as animal farm . as an aside , isn not the language here jarring ? all this talk about harmonious balance when they are talking about taking away people's right to communications privacy ? yes . it looks like the worst nightmares raised by dorothy denning's proposals are coming true . if the government continues on this course , i imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal . encryption programs for disk files and email , as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications , will be distributed only through the underground . people will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy . i have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a message eg meet me at 11 30 to bomb the white house . bring some dynamite to an apparently relatively innoculous message . this message here is an example of the output for the above message . it's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here . it is shockiong that it could happen anywhere . it is shocking that it could happen in a country that has the arrogance to call itself free . what you can do 1 write to your congress person in plain text . 2 write to your congress person in encrypted text . decrypter optional 3 send some random keystroked to your congressperson 4 send some random keystrokes accross the us boundaries , and keep the spooks busy trying to decode it . 5 write your own encryption algorithms. 6 don not buy clipper products . ps i can not work out why the us government doesn not want to sell them overseas . after all , they are rather easy for us interests to decode , so make a perfect tool for industrial military espionage . lulling anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security . you will notice that there is no mention anywhere about safety for non americans . disclaimer my opinions are mine alone , and do not represent anyone elses . i have nothing that i particularly want to hide at the moment . though i consider the right to be able to use whatever method of coding data i like to be high on my list of priorities .   andrew conway phone usa 415 497 1094

3			key	police	right	cipher	crime	chip	scheme	rsa			 competing standard perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the u.s. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative . for example , how about a scheme using rsa , and some hybrid of des cfb and another strong stream cipher maybe idea cfb ? this could be substantially the same as the cripple chip , except that instead of key registration , the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them with a court issued warrant . then , they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you have sent , and assuming you have committed no crimes , you could generate a new key pair and go about your business . i find that i would be willing to pay rsa for the right to use such a system , especially given the alternative . if you were unwilling to give up your secret key , then you would probably stay in jail has anyone got a real legal precedent for this ? this would allow court issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals , but it couldn not be done in secrecy , and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys . maybe someone from the law enforcement or intelligent community will correct me , but this doesn not seem like such a big loss in terms of law enforcement capabilities .  any comments ?  john kelsey

5			concept	mac	notion	belief	morality	punishment	adam	right			 societal basis for morality in david nye  reply to mike cobb  if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that ? what right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality ? pardon the extremism , but couldn not i murder your brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was doing what felt good , didn not want anyone forcing their morality on me , or i don not follow your morality ?  i believe that morality is subjective . each person is entitled to his own moral attitudes . mine are not a priori more correct than someone elses . this does not mean however that i must judge another on the basis of his rather than my moral standards . while he is entitled to believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is offensive to the majority .  why ? how ? might makes right ? how can they force their morality on me ? why can not i do what i want ? who are they to decide ? what if i disagree ? well i agree with you in the sense that they have no moral right to inflict these rules , but there is one thing i might add at the very least , almost everybody wants to avoid pain , and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a herd morality , then so be it .  most criminals do not see their behavior as moral . the may realize that it is immoral and not care . they are thus not following their own moral system but being immoral .  good point , but it is being immoral in our opinion . we don not let them choose , we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them . right , and since they grew up and learned around us , they have some idea of our right and wrong , which i think must , in part , be incorporated . very rarely do you see criminal behaviour for philosophical reasons  for someone to lay claim to an alternative moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be internally consistent . some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense  i admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense , but have little basis for it as of yet . how far can such a concept be extended ?  stuff deleted do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but not him . after all , he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he chose . on what basis do we condemn other societies besides , here's the buzz words , on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all societies ?  holding that morality is subjective does not mean that we must excuse the murderer .  why not ? do we have to be objective suddenly ?  david nye . midelfort clinic , eau claire wi this is patently absurd ; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities . bertrand russell  mac   michael a . cobb . and i won not raise taxes on the middle university of illinois class to pay for my programs. champaign urbana bill clinton 3rd debate  nobody can explain everything to anybody . g . k . chesterton  best regards , adam  adam john cooper verily , often have i laughed at the weaklings 612 696 7521 who thought themselves good simply because they had no claws .
2			price	truth	sport	regulation	series	leaf	condition	country	wheel	brake	car			 diatribe on us sold opels was re opel owners ?  i m looking for information on opel cars . now you ask , which model ? well , the sad truth is , i m not entirely sure , but it's a two seater , with roll over headlights , hard top , and really sporty looking . my friend has one sitting in his yard in really nice condition , body wise , but he transmission has seized up on him , so it hasn not run for a while . does anyone have any info on these cars ? the engine compartment looks really tight to work on , but it is in fine shape and i am quite interested in it . that would be the opel gt , sold in this country from 69 to 73 . it originally had a 1100 cc engine , which was later replaced by the 1900 cc . it was based on the old kadett drive train and suspension , with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front . it looked good , but was limited as a performer . there has also been some discussion in this thread about the manta and other models . in 1971 opel introduced a new line of models , the 1900 series , that were also known as model numbers 51 , 57 , etc. these cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four door coupes , a station wagon , and a sport coupe , known in europe as the manta . at the same time , there were two 30 series cars , which sold very few numbers , that also had the 1900 engine but the kadett suspension . the sport coupe , model 57 was also available as the rallye , 57r , with a blacked out hood , tach , and fog lights , but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio . in 1973 the sport coupe was also named the manta in the us . 1973 was the last year for the gt in any country , both because of the us bumper height regulations and the fact that fiat exercised an option on the factory that opel was leasing to build the gts . the 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences . in 1975 , the manta , 1900 sedan also called the ascona and the wagon were available with bosch electronic fuel injection . these cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels . these cars were starting to compete with the 1975 buick century low price leader of the time , and were the last opels imported into the us . from 1976 to 1979 , cars that sported buick opel badges were still sold by the buick dealers , but were rebadged isuzu i marks . the idea was to call them opels instead of changing the dealers neon signs . various models of the 50 series cars dominated the showroom stock racing of the 70's in their class , and were known as serious 2002 competition . parts are still available from a number of sources . i still have a 73 manta and two 75 sedans and all the trick parts i could collect in 20 years .  john kennedy uunet ! opel ! johnk second source , incorporation annapolis , md

3			price	chip	encryption	clipper			 new encryption  it would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this whole fiasco is the economic standpoint . as others have mentioned , the most difficulty the clipper chip faces is an economic one . let's face it , the average consumer doesn not care or know that the clipper is a bad idea . if there is a perceived need for cellular encryption , then the companies will provide one . most likely , a standard will emerge . but if the clipper is too expensive and $ 25 a chip is way too much then they will develope their own or buy a cheaper one . this is an interesting point . as a very coarse rule of thumb , you can figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the cost of goods . the exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale products that sell tens of millions of units year will be at the low end , those that sell thousands of units year will be at the high end . i suspect cellular phones are in the middle . this implies that adding a $ 25 chip would increase the cost of the phone by approx $ 100 , or about 25 30 . i don not think you will get a lot of consumer support for this . tony usual disclaimer

5			resurrection	context	belief	logic	jesus	mechanism	truth	existence	gospel	god	being	church	game	faith	morality	compound	christian	bible	christ			 christian morality is i love god just as much as she loves me . if she wants to seduce me , she will know what to do . but if he she did you would probably consider it rape . of course not . i would think that would be great fun , not having ever felt the joy and peace the christians speak of with a longing gaze . this is not what i got when i believed i just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something i never was sure of . the bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure . god did not answer . in the end , i found i had been following a mass delusion , a lie . i can not believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence . obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe . so . i suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position . in fact , it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite one should not examine one's belief critically . i will tell you something i left out of my not estimony i posted to this group two months ago . a day after i finally found out my faith is over , i decided to try just one more time . the same cycle of emotional responses fired once again , but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours . i told my friend in a phone that it really works , thank god , just to think about it again when i hung up . i had to admit that i had lied , and fallen prey to the same illusion . no one asks you to swallow everything , in fact jesus warns against it . but let me ask you a question . do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for that matter anything in school . i mean it's just what other people have told you and you don not want to swallow what others say . right . i used to believe what i read in books when i was younger , or what other people told me , but i grew more and more skeptical the more i read . i learned what it means to use reason . as a student of chemistry , i had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab . i hated experiments like this they are old fashioned and increase the student's workload considerably . besides , i had to do it twice , since i failed in my first attempt . however , i think i will never forget the lesson no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is x , it may still be y . it is very tempting to jump into conclusions , take a leap of faith , assure oneself , ignore the data which is inconsistent . but it can still be wrong . i found out that i was , after all , using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god mental self assurance , suspension of fear , filtering of information . in other words , it was only me , no god playing any part . the life , death , and resurection of christ is documented historical fact . oh ? and i had better believe this ? dan , many ufo stories are much better documented than the resurrection of jesus . the resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the bible it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out . besides , the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions ; for instance , the end of mark 16 9 20 is missing from many early texts , says my bible . jesus may have lived and died , but he was probably misunderstood . as much as anything else you learn . how do you choose what to believe and what not to ? this is easy . i believe that the world exists independent of my mind , and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what i observe . nothing else need to be taken on faith , i will go by the evidence . it makes no difference whether i believe george washington existed or not . i assume that he did , considering the vast amount of evidence presented . there is no way to get into a sceptical heart . you can not say you have given a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have . you must trust , not just go to church and participate in it's activities . were you ever willing to die for what you believed ?

4			homosexuality	population	relationship	concept	gay			 a rational viewpoint was re new study out on gay percentage  don not forget about the culture . sadly , we don not as a society look upon homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware , there are alot of people who condemn it . as a result , the gay population is not encouraged to develop non promiscuous relationships . in fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed relationships . it is as if the heterosexual community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays are immoral . my , if we allowed gays to marry , raise children . we might just find out they are as moral as we are , can not have that can we ?  just some thoughts . flame away .  dan this is a very good point . one that i have held for sometime . we do not allow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire . even with heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and information about sexuality and relationships . it is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly that they are wrong and immoral . the concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalism and fear these fears cover a wide range , but mostly jealousy and lack of trust seem to be cornerstones of modern day american relationships . we also set on top of this the concepts of madison avenue attractiveness and standards and put the pressure on to measure up .

3			technique	doctor	unix	interpretation			 do we need a radiologist to read an ultrasound ? my wife's ob gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office . when on her next visit , my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures . the doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not ! my wife is concerned about this . she saw a tv show a couple months back something like 20 20 or dateline nbc , etc. where an expert on fetal ultrasounds a radiologist was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound . should my wife be concerned ? should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion ? and if so , where would we find such an expert in chicago ? we don not really have any special medical reason to be concerned , but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob gyn can not , then i don not see why we shouldn not use one . any thoughts ? as far as i can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation , he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist all doctors are qualified to read x rays , u s , ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing else , and thus , is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this skill in reading x rays etc. just comes from plenty of practice . if your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by this technique . paul .  zikzak public access unix , melbourne , australia .   o o

2			dod	education	bike	brake	rider	technique	wheel			 countersteering faq please post  1 . all of us that argue about gyroscopes , etc . throughly understand the technique of countersteering .  including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner ? well . all the way through a decreasing radius corner , anyway . this is really the only thing we disagree on . maybe we should agree to disagree ? ok but i m right ! the official line here though i do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first , followed by the rear brake , the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place . if that's the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to , that also don not teach countersteering , i have to question the quality of the classes . the official line in msf curricula is as i described . maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the front , as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift . the official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it . applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 , and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0 . saying , brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie . he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is ! it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop .  if you don not slide the tyre , you have no way of knowing whether you have achieved maximum braking or not . i m not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can but if you want to find the limits of the machine , you have to go beyond them . not necessarily true . chirping the tire indicates impending lockup on most surfaces , and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking . i agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider , but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like code used to use . in any case , for maximum braking , if as i suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding , then you will be doing exactly as you suggest ! true , but from the point of view of how to best teach riding skills which is how this discussion started , keep both wheels just on the point of sliding is nearly useless information . you need to teach a technique , or at least a strategy , to achieve this .  ed green , former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker , and i showed him a picture of you . i said , dod 0111 919 460 8302 go on , get to know her , you will like her ! the grateful dead it seemed like the least i could do .

5			christianity	christian	believer	faith	jesus	church	sport	television	messiah	logic	psalm	fool	hitler	bible	god	prophecy			 some thoughts . dan bissell some reasons why he wouldn not be a liar are as follows . who would die for a lie ? wouldn not people be able to tell if he was a liar ? people gathered around him and kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed . call me a fool , but i believe he did heal people . anyone who dies for a cause runs the risk of dying for a lie . as for people being able to tell if he was a liar , well , we have had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization . if david copperfield had been the messiah , i bet he could have found plenty of believers . jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer , and he wasn not the first to be witnessed . what sets him apart ? niether was he a lunatic . would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy . very doubtful , in fact rediculous . for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool , logical people see this right away . rubbish . nations have followed crazies , liars , psychopaths , and megalomaniacs throughout history . hitler , tojo , mussolini , khomeini , qadaffi , stalin , papa doc , and nixon come to mind . all from this century . koresh is a non issue . therefore since he wasn not a liar or a lunatic , he must have been the real thing . take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course . there are flaws in your logic everywhere . and as i m sure others will tell you , read the faq ! some other things to note . he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms , isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone . this in his betrayal and crucifixion . i don not have my bible with me at this moment , next time i write i will use it . of course , you have to believe the bible first just because something is written in the bible does not mean it is true , and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible . so if you do quote from the bible in the future , try to back up that quote with supporting evidence . otherwise , you will get flamed mercilessly . i don not think most people understand what a christian is . it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches . rather i think it should be a way of life , and a total sacrafice of everything for god's sake . he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same . hey we can not do it , god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him . that's tuff and most people don not want to do it , to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at . but just like weight lifting or guitar playing , drums , whatever it takes time . we don not rush it in one day , christianity is your whole life . it is not going to church once a week , or helping poor people once in a while . we box everything into time units . such as work at this time , sports , tv , social life . god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves . just like weight lifting or guitar playing , eh ? i don not know how you define the world total , but i would imagine a total sacrafice sp of everything for god's sake would involve more than a time commitment . you are correct about our tendency to box everything into time units . would you explain how one should involove god in sports and hehehe television ?   kevin marshall computer science department virginia tech blacksburg , virginia 703 232 6529
5			atheist	nature	morality	truth	christian	context			 after 2000 years , can we say that christian morality is very true length of time for discussions on creationism vs evolutionism . atheists and christians have been debating since ? and still debate with unabated passion 8 . mike , i have seen referrences to creation vs evolution several times in a . a and i have question . is either point of view derived from direct observation ; can either be scientific ? i wonder if the whole controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the truth rather than the truth itself . both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome , and i can not help wondering which came first as i have pointed out elsewhere , my view of human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing anyhthing objectively all knowledge is inherently subjective . so , in the context of a . a , would you take a stand based on what you actually know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell the difference ? bill

5			concept	understanding	god	context	revelation	perspective			 yeah , right and what about that revelation thing , charley ? if you are talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation , well , it's obviously a risk one takes . many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge is contradictive . i m not an objectivist , so i m not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization . the problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience . one can get some rough understanding , but the language is , from the perspective of ordinary phenomena , inconsistent , and from the perspective of what's being described , rather inexact to be charitable . an analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics ; the problem is that the better descriptive language is not available . and in case it holds reliable information , can you show how you establish that ? this word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you can show how reliability can be determined .  c . wingate the peace of god , it is no peace , but strife closed in the sod . yet , brothers , pray for but one thing tove ! mangoe the marv lous peace of god .

4			firearm	mr.	war	gun	officer	revolver	cop	handgun	target			 don not knock the glock was re my gun is like my am ex card  all very true . i m going on what i have read and heard from friends . basically the glock is great but i have heard read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has . i was looking at a glock . 40s&w and the s&w 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different . the saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more safe for lack of a better word than the one on the glock . of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody . you would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off . personally i like the glocks because they are very light and i think they look really cool guess that's why they use them in so many movies but i wouldn not get one as my first semi auto because of the safety . i would prefer more training with a traditional semi auto ala colt . 45 but of course that's just my opinion .  jason at the risk of starting the my gun is better than yours flame war , i must disagree .  there is no secret in handling a glock . in fact , it is often chosen besides its other merits because it shoots like a revolver does basically . it can limit the training time read budget $ $ $ due to the fact there are no external safties other than the trigger , hence less training time required . smith & wesson among other types are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties hammer drop , as well as mag drop which if properly used have saved many lives when mr. bad snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire . this point had been made in many articles in various gun magazines . if fact , one author can not remember who staged a little test where he had a revolver and a s&w on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal , grab the gun and shoot a target . he timed the people using each gun . the revolver times were pretty close , but some of the times with the s&w were in minutes , or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey . you don not often see colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation , opening the issuing city , county , etc . to lawsuits , bad press , etc . of course any problem can be overcome with enough training , but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments . i know if i were a cop i would want something like a s&w just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away . the safety doesn not guarantee that mr. bad won not figure it out and shoot me , but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot mr. bad before it's too late . don not think i am too biassed here just because i have had 3 glocks in my possession at one time , because i have had a . 45 as well . in fact , it was my first handgun . remember , the ultimate 'safety is you the operator , and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge note i don not say accidental if you break the rules of gun handling . as per the part of being light weight and looking cool , i agree 100 . i wouldn not rule it out as a first purchase . just my $ . 02 tax steve syck

1			los	angeles			 ellipse again ellipse hi ! everyone , because no one has touched the problem i posted last week , i guess my question was not so clear . now i would like to describe it in detail the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse . in other words , the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere . this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used . the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center . is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse ? the answer is no ! ironically , dmis an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse . so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong . the software was also sold internationaly . imagine , how many people have or will suffer from this bug ! how many qualified parts with ellipse were will be discarded ? and most importantly , how many defective parts with ellipse are will be used ? i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem . i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming . now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset . it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical . i am now wondering if i didn not touch the base and make things complicated . please give me a hint . i know you may argue this is not a cg problem . you are right , it is not . however , so many people involved in the problem sphere from 4 poits . why not an ellipse ? and why not its offset ? please post here and let the others share our interests i got several emails from our netters , they said they need the summary of the answers . yeh usc
4			war	armenian	content	armenia	aid	village	arm	weapon	country	state	right	azeri	azerbaijan	greece	turkey			 armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes henrik the armenians in nagarno karabagh are simply defending their henrik rights to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are henrik invading their homeland . he homeland ? first nagarno karabagh was armenians homeland today he fizuli , lacin and several villages in azerbadjan he are their homeland . can not you see the he the great armenia dream in this ? with facist methods like he killing , raping and bombing villages . the last move was the he blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees , trying to he escape the from lacin , a city that was given to the kurds he by the armenians . nagorno karabakh is in azerbaijan not armenia . armenians have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were armenians . armenians used to live in the areas between armenia and nagorno karabakh and this area is being used to invade nagorno karabakh . armenians are defending themselves . if azeris are dying because of a policy of attacking armenians , then something is wrong with this policy . attacking ? who is attacking who ? even the country you live in , usa , have condemned armenia for it's attacking . and you start to say that the attackers are the azeris ?  armenians have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were armenians ? azeris have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were azeris . don not come with nonsence , there is no reason to attack a people just because a man called gorbatjov and co . gave the freedom to the people in this area . if i recall correctly , it was stalin who caused all this problem with land in the first place , not the armenians .  it's easy for people like you to blame history . the were a lot of indians living in usa . there is no reason for these indians to attack the american people and say it was the fault of the government of germany and great britain , because they made people come to our place . armenians lived in harmony with the azeris until gorbatjov and co . gave freedom to the people in karabag , then the armenians started to kill , rape and torture the azeris , not only in karabag but also noe in azerbadjan . henrik however , i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane henrik to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one henrik that happened last summer . turkey searched an american plane henrik carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia . he don not speak about things you don not know 8 u.s. cargo planes he were heading to armenia . when the turkish authorities he announced that they were going to search these cargo he planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in germany . he 5 of these planes were searched in turkey . the content of he of the other 3 planes ? not hard to guess , is it ? it was sure not he humanitarian aid . what story are you talking about ? planes from the u.s. have been sending aid into armenian for two years . i would not like to guess about what were in the 3 planes in your story , i would like to find out . he search turkish planes ? you don not know what you are talking about . he turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons he to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan he it self , not the karabag province . so why search a plane for weapons he since it's content is announced to be weapons ? it's too bad you would want turkey to start a war with armenia .  that's what i don not want , you couldn not imagine the result of a war . so france , greece and usa wants to start fighting with azerbadjan ? they give a lot more weapons to the armenians without saying it , that's no secret any more . i must say that these armenian government is very shortsighted . do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war is over ? the neighbour around will be there and armenia must live in harmony with these if they don not want a stone age country , for that's what's will happen armenia if the wars continues .  look , the president of turkey , turgut ozal , died and petrosyan the armenian presindent is now in turkey for the funeral . is it because he liked him ? sure not , because armenia needs it's neighbours and must live with these . but armenia can not stop this war with continued ordertaking from states like france and usa . with other words , if you love your people you must think twice . and i wonder , shoot down turkish planes with what ? ohhh i forgot the armenians can not find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned countries . hilmi eren stockholm university sweden

5			atheist	belief	god	atheism	worship	genocide			 genocide is caused by atheism  and in that area , what you care about is whether someone is sceptical , critical and autonomous on the one hand , or gullible , excitable and easily led on the other .  indeed i may . and one may be an atheist and also be gullible , excitable and easily led .  i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led . whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point .  sure . but whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing , not whether they are easily led .  not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible , excitable and easily led from some concrete cause . in that case we would also have to discuss if that concrete cause , rather than atheism , was the factor that caused their subsequent behaviour .  i m not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour merely that it is not relevant to the definition of atheism , which is lack of belief in gods . throw away the faq . we can all just ask mr o would wyer , since he can define the thing that the rest of us only talk about . jon .

4			border	country	war	shipping			 rejoinder . questions to israelis in a previous article , center for policy research says today ? finally , if israel wants peace , why can not it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders , which might be a base for negotiations ? having all the above facts in mind , one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism , as a number of wars have proved 1948 , 1956 , 1967 , 1982 . oh yeah , israel was really ready to expand its borders on the holiest day of the year yom kippur when the arabs attacked in 1973 . oh wait , you chose to omit that war . perhaps because it 100 supports the exact opposite to the point you are trying to make ? i don not think that it's because it was the war that hit israel the hardest also , in 1967 it was egypt , not israel who kicked out the un force . in 1948 it was the arabs who refused to accept the existance of israel based on the borders set by the united nations . in 1956 , egypt closed off the red sea to israeli shipping , a clear antagonistic act . and in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the golan heights . children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and israel finally retaliated . nowhere do i see a war that israel started so that the borders could be expanded .  steve   internet fidonet 1 163 109 . 18  my opinions are not associated with anything , including my head .

2						 vfr st11 owners get hidden feature lights  well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a 2 position switch , but sure enough as deam expected , when you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high and low beams go on .  this provides a very nice light coverage of the road .   hmmmm i noticed sometime ago that i could do the same on my virago , and since i don not read many schematics , i didn not really think aobut it too much . yes it does provide excellent coverage , but i figured it would probably draw a little too much current . i also figured that it was overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight . are you saying that these switches are designed for the hi lo combination ?  jay hamillton xv1000 with more chrome than a harley time to change the oil again ? ! ! ! dod 982 and kotcm

2			game	score	play	inning			 game length was re braves update ! i hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write , but neither of you two sound as though you have kids , and you may not have spouses either . i wonder why you say that ? i don not see why having a spouse and or kids would have anything to do with it . it might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour in which case i would probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends , as many people do , or else be prepared to leave the game early , but from what you say later on , you don not bring your kids or your spouse to the game . as it happens , i have a husband but no kids , and my husband usually attends games with me . extra innings could put me well past midnight . even without extra innings , if the score is beyond 2 1 i can not see my family that night at all . if the next day is a workday , i may have to bag that as well . i can see it's a problem if you don not bring your wife to the ballgame , but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1 2 hours . as far as bagging work the next day , i don not really understand why that's necessary , unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer i note that this is the case for many guys . if you don not think you can get up to go to work after a long evening out , then don not have long evenings out during the week . all that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game . if you say you don not care about whether the game is sped up , impo you are saying you don not care where the time goes , and that the game is for people who don not have families and don not have to get up for work the next day . look if i pay between $ 8 . 00 and $ 20 . 00 apiece for tickets , plus $ 10 . 00 for parking , plus spending my time and energy driving to and from boston , plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark , then i see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money . i can not afford to go to a lot of games . hence , going to a game is a big deal , like going to a play or an opera . maybe you have more money than i do and can go to games all year long , so it's not such a big deal for you . but i m not interested in having games sped up , any more than i want to have die walkure cut down to a convenient weeknight version of two hours . if i felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere with my family life or my work life , then i would choose to go to a weekend game . impo . heather

3			clipper	play	manufacturer	concern	chip			 fighting the clipper initiative as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist , i at a loss for specific objections that don not sound frighteningly technical . the idea that foisting the cripple chip standard on us manufacturers would result in saying sayonara to yet another high tech market isn not technical , isn not in the least difficult to understand , and plays on a concern lots of people are worried about already .
5			religion	faith	context	technique			 cults who keeps them going ? . bad thoughts these .  well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of cult and say all faiths are cults , or if you take a more social context view of cult which allows you to recognize mainstream religions as socially acceptable and cults as groups that involve techniques of brain washing and all the other characteristics that define oppressive probly not the best word cult behaviour . yeah , but implicitly the social context view provides a justification for the dictionary definition of a cult ; those who follow the mainstream pretend while those in cults act based on the very same impulses . now who is to be taken seriously ? ; i m confused . could you restate what yer saying in those who follow the mainstream pretend and act based on the very same impulses ?
5			peter	james	truth	jesus	bible	god	perspective	priest	existence	arrogance	christian	hundred			 is it good that jesus died ? would you consider the word of an eye witness peter to testify to the events surrounding jesus life ? no. there are two problems here 1 peter died two millenia ago . the original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust if he were alive today and i could do you question the existence of alexander the great , tilgrath pilisar iii , nero , caligula , josephus , cyrus the great , artexerxes ? their documents have decayed to dust too . brian , why another excuse ? 2 even if peter did witness the miracles of jesus two millenia ago , that doesn not mean that your deity is what the bible says it is god might just be satan , trying to convince everyone that he's a nice guy , or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today . peter wrote a bit of the bible . what peter says about god is what the bible says . consider the bible a court recording . over the period of thousands of years , various people come up and testify of their experience with the living god . up comes abraham the wealthy rancher . up comes moses , once the high official of egypt . up comes elijah , a priest up comes david , a mere shepherd who became king . up comes the pagan king nebuchanezzar . up comes the pagan king of persia , cyrus . up comes nehemiah , cupbearer to the king of persia . then matthew , an irs agent takes the stand . up comes luke , an m . d . then paul a jew who use to kill christians for fun . up comes john , a 17 year old boy . up comes peter , a fishermen . up comes james , the brother of jesus himself . up comes hundreds of others . you hear testimony from fishermen , irs agents , priests , kings . the court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the god who calls himself i am . while you are listening to all this stuff , you realize that king david could have never known john , solomon could have never known matthew , nehemiah could have never known peter . you realize that all these people are independent witnesses , and so , you rule out collaboration . yet all of the witnesses tell of the same god . each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living god . each experience is different , but each experience has enough cross over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same god . what daniel did not know about god , the 3rd highest official of babylon , god revealed to john 600 years later but with a different perspective . no two testimonies are identical . each testimony dares to venture off what is already known . yet each witness's testimony , even though different from those prior , consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same god . now . as we stare gazing at the computer , you got this seeming fanatic on the other end of the net , saying , i know this god i am . he has revealed himself to me too . he also calls himself jesus john 8 58 . please believe me . i am telling the truth . it is wonderful to know him . are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness ? are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer programmers , fiction ? with a scoff of your keyboard , with near complete ignorance of the testimonies , are you going to say that that is all complete hooey ? would that not be the most audacious display of arrogance ? do you actually think you know better than king solomon , king david , or even abraham lincolnr ?

2			cup	nhl	goalie	league	game	peter	player	team			 finland sweden vs . nhl teams was helsinki stockholm & nhl expansion finland  d jyrki lumme . 20 d teppo numminen . 20 d peter ahola . 13  well well , they don not like our defenders mainly lumme and numminen . about 25 is correct for numminen and lumme . r teemu selanne . 27  compared to kurri , selanne's points are too high , lets make it 25 or 26 . no , kurri's points are too low . 27 for kurri and 28 for sel nne . well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie , 3 4 or the players listed above and luck . there's presumably a lot of decent players in finland that wouldn not be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players , however . my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a . 500 team in the nhl . wow , now , it looks like you don not like our players ? what about guys like nieminen , jutila , riihijarvi , varvio , laukkanen , makela , keskinen and even if he is aging ruotsalainen ? the main difference between finnish and north american players is , that our players tend to be better in the larger rink . the canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in europe . and i think that there was more in our success than ketterer and luck though they helped . i think that the main reason was , that the team worked well together . that's true . game is so different here in europe compared to nhl . north ame ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks . an average european player from sweden , finland , russian or tsech slovakia is a better skater and puckhandler than his nhl colleague . especially defenders in nhl are mainly slow and clumsy . sel nne has also said that in the finnish sm league game is more based on skill than in nhl . in finland he couldn not get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in nhl . also alpo suhonen said that in nhl sel nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen . i have to admit that the best players come from canada , but those regulars aren not as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues . also top europeans are in the same level as the best north americans . except lemieux is in the class of his own . tommi

4			defense	gun			 statement to everyone on t . p . g  andy freeman says  clue kratz position isn not a defense against inaccuracy .  i oppose gun control because it doesn not work . if it did , i would support it . in fact , i supported gun control before i did my homework .  there's no demand for pro gun people who don not know what they are talking about . in fact , they would be much better off if they didn not say anything .  and why is this freeman ? even if a pro gun person doesn not know what they are talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or two . i am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what i have to say . i have several good sources of material now that i know where to look so calm down . there's lots of information flowing on tpg for those interested in learning . one can participate in those discussions without ranting inaccurately . failure to do so has consequences .  ah , freeman seems to forget from my statement that i am learning . i have also asked several of the not so hostile folks on this group for sources of information to read . do you think , freeman , that maybe this means i am interested in learning ? i think it does because as you said people who don not know anything won not be good for the pro gun cause . another good habit to get into is to go read only for a while , to take the time to figure out how things work .  another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you freeman and accept mistakes . sure , maybe it could have been some type of misinformation being slung by some anti gun nut but it wasn not . i made my statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don not worry about it but also to learn as much as you can . they accepted my mistake and gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible . i have read several posts of yours and have found them informative . why don not you give me the same chance ? andy jason
4			price	building	education	apartment	tie	state	right	street	improvement	abuse	game	car			 employment was re why not concentrate on child molesters ?   so ? what does this prove ? i do not object to property ownership i just think property ownership should be limited to what an individual person family needs . i do not need 200 , 000 acres to survive , i need about 3 acres at most and could get by on less . i argue that by having all property tied up and thus cutting people off form the basic level of subsistance that the property owners must bribe the rest of us to respect their ownership rights by providing alternative means of subsistance . when we are expected to give these peoperty owners lets call them thieves bribes in order to be able to subsists then we have a sick situation . the property owners are then parasites .  i want people to be able to live happy and prosperous lives . property owners cannot maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unless they have help from a coercive government . when a few land owners get together and try to control all the land without selling , land prices will go up . at some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner to sell some of his property . trying to put a group of people to distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the land , and would have the consequences you speak of . let's keep the land out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market .  it's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism of land . other than government land , saved for posterity and the eco system as well as government function , the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before . the game of capitalism is almost won . the game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly , or else be enslaved in return for a place to live . here in central california , already , fewer than 30 own all the property and 5 of them own 90 of it . that's twice what it was twenty years ago . rents are so high that you pay 60 of your income for rent . if you just have a mcjob , all you can afford is one room , if that . some 30 of minimum wage workers are homeless . unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them , in the midst of 30 unemployment in high tech jobs ! you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child ! and everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs . the only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to , clothing used , food poor . no movies , no entertainment , ect . for about five to seven years , and then , if you have saved $ 20 , 000 , if you can get together that much , and that's ignoring your kids and working two jobs , then you can buy a home in arkansas or missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year ! that's an people's houses and find a sturdy hill , then you can buy one up there ! also buy a rowboat . missouri's not so bad , if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter . they really do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether ! shit , kill the rich and redistribute the livable property . kill all of them ! rsw i want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more . is there a workable system for what you suggest ? i am always looking for improvements on the way we can coexist in this world and will give people happy , meaningful lives , where each individual can reach their highest potential . are you asking for the forced redistribution of land ? any system i imagine will lead to unfairnes , pollution , over popullation , and land mismanagement . if you know of such a system , please describe it . please be specific , since my imagination cannot comprehend such a system . specifics that i am interested in 1 . does someone get land assigned them when they are born ? 2 . what happens to someone's land when they die ? can they pass it on to their children ? 3 . can someone sell land ? 4 . can someone leaase their land ? 5 . what governmental restrictions will be put on land use ? 6 . who will administer such a system ? 7 . how much will it cost to administer such a system ? i know that this is alot to ask and will understand if you do not have the time to answer these questions . i think i will be better able to understand what you are proposing , if you can answer these quesitons . paul schmidt advocates for self government , davy crockett chapter president  the land is simply granted to people who live on it now . extra is kept for the future . you get to stay where you are without paying rent . land that supports others becomes property of the state . farmers are welcome to plant crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality . if you want to grow sourgum because you always did , and you aren not doing a good job , then we let another farmer grow sorghum , and you grow something else . when people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings . no one can sell land , but they can trade places with anybody . no one can lease land . the government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences . residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability . the local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils . it will cost no more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a deep dark hole to the owners ! anyone can submit a request for a larger house or land to start a business on , depending on a valid business plan and community needs . heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public good or as needed . heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in service to the community . companies who own many machines are to be divided among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid operators on a need basis . cost of upkeep is charged . a guild of heavy machine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake . their council is a subcouncil to the community council . etc. etc. etc. it isn not so hard to think of a better system than we have . all you have to do is realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct , in fact it's a rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could be already ! the trick is to realize that the old rich have been making the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the merry go round . tax the rich to death . they are the ones that converted your 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today . they are the ones who always cut education . they are the ones who always raise the rent when you get a raise . they are the ones who should be not just dislodged but killed for their abuse . i have trouble justifying the death penalty for a poor kid who killed and didn not know why not . i have no trouble justifying the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed their greed ! have you paid rent most of your life ? then you have been enslaved , percentage wise , most of your life . we used to be serfs . now we are called renters , and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own land they don not use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to own it . most rents in california are enough to buy the apartment house , paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with ! i have seen the books ! i know what my landlord pays and to whom ! i know what i pay her . i am being forced to buy her a building and then i will be let out at the other end with nothing , when i had as much right as her to live on this planet ! and her child will have the money to likewise enslave my child . i hope i find out when i am going to die . i can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine . and maybe i can take a few other landlords with me , and their heirs . that would be worth it . then to be able to die before they can do anything to me . that's a poor man's dream . sleep tight , bastard landlords . you don not know the trouble you are buying yourself as you sleep on my heirs money in your mattress ! rsw  richard steven walz 408 429 1200 515 maple street 1 without safe and free abortion women are santa cruz , ca 95060 organ surrogates to unwanted parasites . real men would never accept organ slavery and will protect women .

5			concern	explanation	religion	god	nature	truth	understanding	meaning	christianity	contradiction			 science and theories as per various threads on science and creationism , i have started dabbling into a book called christianity and the nature of science by jp moreland . as i don not know this book , i will use your heresay . a question that i had come from one of his comments . he stated that god is not necessarily a religious term , but could be used as other scientific terms that give explanation for events or theories , without being a proven scientific fact . it depends on how he defines god . the way i understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science . ideas drawn from an understanding that god is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them . some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable , and especially subserviant in a basic way , to religious dogma . this pursuit always fails . i think i got his point i can quote the section if i m being vague . the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates . are there explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of themselves , or can everything be quantified , measured , tested , etc . reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way . it gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits . science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers , at best science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions . more questions can be posed than it can answer . at the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction . bruce salem
3			pgp	announcement			 the secret source of that announcement  something similar has happened to me ages ago when we were working on pgp we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test new features around . now at this time pgp and certainly the newer version was unknown over here . suddenly the admin at the site i was using received a request that i stop sending encrypted email . now there is almost no way that some automatic scanner could have found this , since they wouldn not have known about pgp they must have checked for unknown data types in the message , tried to unscramble it , found they couldn not get past the pem armour part , and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop . luckily the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their networks . is the sending of encrypted traffic without government permission legal in new zealand ? david  david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information , errors and omissions excepted .

3			mechanism	god	space	peter	state			 gamma ray bursters . where are they ? if all of these things have been detected in space , has anyone looked into possible problems with the detectors ? that is , is there some mechanism cosmic rays , whatever that could cause the dector to think it was seeing one of these things ? graydon that would not explain why widely separated detectors , such as on ulysses and pvo and ginga et al . would see a burst at the same time . in fact , be fore batse , having this widely separated interplanetary network was the only sure way to locate a random burst with only one detector , one cannot locate a burst except to say it's somewhere in the field of view . with two detectors , one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky . with three detectors , one gets intersecting annuli , giving two possible locations . if one of these locations is impossible because , say , the earth blocked that part of the sky , voila , you have an error box . batse , by having 8 detectors of its own , can do its own location determination , but only to within about 3 degrees would someone at gsfc , like david , like to comment on the current state of location determination ? having inde pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty . you did touch on something that you didn not mean to , though . some believe in a reference that i have somewhere that absorption like features seen in a fraction of grbs can actually be caused by the detector . it would be a mean , nasty god , though , that would have a nai crystal act like a 10 12 gauss neutron star . but this is getting too far afield . peter

3			assault			 centi and milli pedes  does anyone know how posionous centipedes and millipedes are ? if someone was bitten , how soon would medical treatment be needed , and what would be liable to happen to the person ?  just for clarification i have not been bitten by one of these , but my house seems to be infested , and i want to know just in case .  rebecca   millipedes , i understand , are vegetarian , and therefore almost certainly will not bite and are not poisonous . centipedes are carnivorous , and although i don not have any absolute knowledge on this , i would tend to think that you are in no danger from anything but a concerted assault by several million of them .  g . not sure of this but i think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction sting ? so i would not assume that they are not dangerous merely on the basis of vegetarianism , after all wasps are vegetarian too . dnc . as a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful sting , but it quickly subsided . much less painful compared to a bee sting . centipedes have a poison claw one of the front feet to stun their prey , but in my single experience it did not have a lot of bite to it . a .

3			condition	ice	advance	circuit	electronics	state			 help with ultra long timing i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design . what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer . what they want to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six weeks . every two weeks , they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the snow . then by digging down into the snow , the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color pellets .  the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold 40 degrees and a power source that wouldn not drain . i have looked at the xr 2204 timers and the standard ne556 dual timers , but thier temp specs won not go that low . also , two weeks equates to 1 , 209 , 600 seconds per firing , which means one big timing cap ! i have found 2 . 2 farad yes , farad ! caps that have a working voltage of 5 volts and are small in size . but again , the time of discharge at 40 or lower degrees isn not linear . i was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period , but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain . one possibility would be to use solar panels , but this is during the six month twilight . anyone have any good ideas ?  thanks in advance .  wes firstly , i would never consider trying to make a one shot timer . your 2f2 cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute , rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current . their performance , in some respects , is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap . the other point is that big electro's are usually rated with 5 20 tolerances , so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold . you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain , that rolls over from zero to maximum count , or vice versa once every 1 , 209 , 600 seconds . if you were to use something like a 110hz clock , you would need a divider chain of 2 27 , to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period . of course , you could trim the 110hz oscillator to give you exact time , but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at 40 is low anyway . i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit . caveat i m not experienced in low temperature electronics , so i can not guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable conditions . johnh  electronics department school of mpce macquarie university sydney , australia 2109 email , ph 61 2 805 8959 , fax 61 2 805 8983

3			key	scheme	communication	agency	logic	chip	target	clipper	privacy	algorithm	encryption	state	session	relationship			 will feds troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks ? originator koontzd phobos from denning the skipjack encryption algorithm f , an 80 bit family key that is common to all chips n , a 30 bit serial number u , an 80 bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip e m ; k , the encrypted message stream , and e e k ; u n ; f , a law enforcement block . where the session key is k , and is transmitted encrypted in the unit key u . which along with the serial number n is encrypted in the family key f . presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else , differential analysis . postulate if you will , a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel . the function of this spoof chip is twofold  1 transmit channel the spoof chip xors the 30 bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable . this renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key 2 receive channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable assuming integrity of the law enforcement block is necessary for local operation checksums , sequence control , etc . this has the net result of hiding the serial number . it is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing n 34 bits as used in generating u , u1 , u2 correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key f . whereas , no one has proposed federal agencies be denied f , and because they could recover it themselves , the correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of n in e n ; f . the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above , but the mutilation could be detected . a better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block . if it were done with a group encryption scheme such as des or presumably skipjack , the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened . what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search ? when digital transmission becomes widely available , would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks ? one way to avoid notice , would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing m , as well as spoofing the law enforcement block . the goal is to use a secure communications scheme , without redress to detection or key k interception contained encrypted within the law enforcement block . the data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip or system if required , for proper operation . it is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip , yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for , requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting e m ; k ; the spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols , including on the resulting serial data stream . existing clipper products could be subborned . after all , they are high security encryption systems right ? super encipherment encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip , or disclosure of the serial number . security must be adequate to deny the serial number , which should not be recoverable by other means . one can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones , or once the number of units is high enough , stealing them . it would be a mistake on the part of authority , but nice from a point of privacy , if the serial number n were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process . hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers n encrypted with f , and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream . this could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream . detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme .  if you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own , and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own , where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission , you could simply out and out lie , yet deliver to monitoring and or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block . these captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators , such as in a manually keyed encryption system . fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission . the m code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext . this could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmitted stream , under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints . the useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception . you would need a large number of them , but , hey there's supposed to be millions of these things , right ? adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical , who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock ?  the entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated .

2			jay	hitter	baseball	season	catcher	game	brave	pitcher	talent	context	defense	james	team			 young catchers  at age 23 alomar had a brilliant rookie year . true , he was limited by injuries in his sophomore season , but his numbers both that yaer and the year following were quite mediocre . this season the same bill james projects a ba of . 265 , ops of 675 . the same bill james ? why do you say that ? it sounds like you are suggesting bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death . au contraire ; he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign , noting that he wasn not all world as a catcher or a hitter . he called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy campanella . both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers , expected to be among the best ever in baseball . the reports i read indicate that lopez is very ordinary defensively . which reports are those ? the dodgers options are parrish and hernandez , and now only carlos . piazza is 24 . as long as he continues with his very hot bat , they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive production . when he cools off , look for the much better defensive catcher hernandez only 25 to play more . i like hernandez a lot , but if piazza can catch the ball , you have gotta play him imho . he's a much better hitter , although hernandez isn not a bad hitter . right now , it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler . as long as they play up to their abilities , the dodgers could have a very good catching tandem . the braves options are berryhill and olson . i agree that olson is nothing special , but i do think berryhill is better than many people on rsb believe . but both the braves catchers are very good defensively calling a game , blocking the plate , throwing and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively , they play on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat . i think both are overrated defensively see nichols law of catcher defense , but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine . about the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's sb , and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners . catchers era is a possibility , but it's subject to way too many biases . as for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat , i disagree here too . about the only chink in the braves armor is that they are weak offensively at several positions cf , c , 2b , ss if belliard plays , 1b unless bream and hunter form another super platoon and very weak defensively if blauser plays . i would like to see the braves give at least one of mel nieves , javy lopez or chipper jones a shot , but much like the talent rich jays of recent years they will be conservative and stick with what they have . i m not saying that's wrong , just conservative .   dave hung like a jim acker slider kirsch blue jays do it again in 93 new . quotes out of context ! not to beat a dead horse , but it's been a couple o weeks . this disappoints me . punishments . discharges . jackhammering . stephen lawrence

2			price	minnesota	nhl	hockey	game	team	season	play	state	sale	town	fan			 minnesota shame ? i have been under the impression that minnesota was one of , or possibly , the hockey state in the u.s. so why is the team moving to a city in texas ? is it that the owner is a greedy , self serving profiteer , or were the stars really not making a profit ? or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging ? norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team . when he bought the team , it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red , before the team started making a profit again . he gave the impression that he was willing to do so . he claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 8000 fans per game in order to pull a profit , but this season the team averaged 12000 fans , despite increasd ticket prices . i think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend , which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move . he was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded , such as guaranteed season ticket sales , cheap rent at the other two arenas in town , etc. oh well , i guess the bottom line is $ $ $ . green wanted immediate huge returns in dallas , and wasn not willing to wait another year or so in mn . dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesota's was quite reasonable , and he also has some cronies down there as well . all this means , is that minnesota is without an nhl team for a year or two . too bad for the nhl . kea

5			christian	belief	cross	faith	god	truth	doctor	christianity			 how i got saved . well , i was certainly turned off by that first paragraph of oft used platitudes . i can not count the times i have heard those common tactics anymore . you may not believe it but that doesn not change the fact that it's true . the old analogy about trusting your parents . sheesh . need i point out how parents can show children that they are right ? that difference in capability alone crushes that analogy , as any facts about christianity i have seen turned out to be beliefs . what i seek is fact knowledge if i can get it , and evidence for a belief if i can not . so far from christians i have received neither . before becoming a christian i too had problems when i asked one to explain it to me . the actual evidence is not always what you see on a person's outside . it should be but is not always . a very specific , somewhat miraculous example of the truth of god working to help his followers is soemthing that happened to me . for nearly 4 years after an accident i had severe complications from a triple fracture in my left leg and surgery pins put in , then removed . the bone itself was perfectly healed . no infectoin that could be detected . yet i was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and bluish . more complicatios developed in my other leg , none of which could be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te northern illinois region . we went everywhere no one could explain it . durin gthat summer june 19 , 1991 to be exact i gave my life and heart to christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life which i never really had anyway because of what he did for me on the cross and the fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it . i was facing the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair i was confined to one in order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems were unknown , had been in it for about 2 1 2 months before that day . i found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after i put my faith where my mouth was , one more in the long line of doctors and not even an orthopeodic specialist , diagnosed my problems with no difficulty , set me on the path to an effective cure , and i was walking and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for 4 years . the diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have overlooked because it was perfectly obvious from my test results . maybe this doesn not hit you as miraculous . but to me it really is . imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to walk mcuh longer . and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run knowing that the problem was there all along and was revealed just after she did what she knew was right . as the song says . our god is an awesome god .

3			industry	window			 is msg sensitivity superstition ? many people responded with more anecdotal stories ; i think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories . presumably , he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about msg making people ill . there has been no hard info provided about msg making people ill . that's the point , after all . like youself ? someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition ? have you read olney's work ? i fail to see how citing results from peer reviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked . that's because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people , they are looking at animal models . you can not walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans . note that i wouldn not have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah , blah , we must be careful about its use in humans . this is precisely not what you said . tests have been done on rhesus monkeys , as well . i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular . the glu and asp were administered orally . some studies used iv and sc . intra ventricular is not a normal admin . method for food tox . studies , for obvious reasons . you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk . it most certainly is for neurotoxicology . you know , studies of glutamate involve more than food science . pardon me , but where are you getting this from ? have you read the journals ? have you done a thorough literature search ? so , point us to the studies in humans , please . i m familiar with the literature , and i have never seen any which relate at all to olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons . the point is exceeding the window . of course , they are amino acids . note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine . well , actually , they have to tolerate some phenylalanine ; it's a essential amino acid . they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood . olney's research compared infant human diets . specifically , the amount of freely available glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods , vs . typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes . he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods . mother's milk was well below the effective dose . goodness , i m not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods . it's just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that , you can prove anything you like . we are talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here , yet you are misrepresenting it as received wisdom . read olney's review paper in prog . brain res , 1988 , and check his sources . they are impecable . there is no dispute .  impeccable . there most certainly is a dispute .  between who ? over what ? i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever . you mean asserting . you are being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused , because you are conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other . olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants , but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods , nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons . it says nothing about msg's contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome . it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab .  hmm . com . why am i not surprised ? dianne murray probably one of the dumber remarks you have made .  steve dyer aka ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c ! spdcc ! dyer

2			hitter	player	bank	hitler	pitch	pitcher	patient			 hbp ? bb ? big cat ? ken kubey said  and finally , i would like to point out that many high obp guys draw their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them , than because they have a great eye  i m not sure . i used to think this was true , but more and more i m becoming convinced that it's the other way around among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard , the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot .  let's break down the four basic categories of hitter , according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot   power no power  patient frank thomas brett butler barry bonds ozzie smith mark mcgwire craig grebeck babe ruth miller huggins ted williams billy hamilton rickey henderson eddie joost joe morgan mike hargrove . . .  impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen dave kingman shawon dunston joe carter andres thomas george bell jose lind kirby puckett devon white okay , i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a strike or two and try to get on base any way they can . so the no power impatient guys have no excuse . the no power patient guys are doing the right thing . now the impatient power guys how could you leave out the big cat ? would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches ? perhaps , but i doubt it . if you tell joe carter to go up there and take a few pitches , he will draw more walks , but he also won not hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive . the patient power guys ? joe morgan had a small strike zone and rickey henderson has a strike zone the size of hitler's heart so they get their walks based on the small zone . look at the other 5 guys thomas , bonds , mcgwire , ruth and williams. wow ! a lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them . the pitchers would do better in my opinion by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch , but pitchers would rather nibble , go 2 0 or 3 1 and then get hurt . ken kubey 415 390 3536

5			cheer	fool	logic	bible	jesus	morality	peter			 christian morality is peter simple logic arguments are folly . if you read the bible you will see that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic . our ability to reason is just a spec of creation . yet some think it is the ultimate . if you rely simply on your reason then you will never know more than you do now . to learn you must accept that which you don not know .  can anyone eaplain what he's just said here ? i can not . it seems jesus used logic to make people using logic look like fools ? no , that does not sound right , he maybe just told they were fools , and that's it , and people believed that . hmm , does not sound reasonable either . i find it always very intriguing to see people stating that transcendental values can not be explained , and then in the next sentence they try to explain these unexplained values . highly strange . cheers , kent  . alink ksand private activities on the net .

3			proposal			 why not give $ 1 billion to first year lo this prize isn not big enough to warrent developing a ssto , but it is enough to do it if the vehicle exists .  actually , there are people who will tell you that it would be enough to do ssto development , if done privately as a cut rate operation . of course , they may be over optimistic .  you can also assume that a working ssto would have other applications that would help pay for its development costs .  i would be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger , but $ 1g might be enough . this all sounds like that indecent proposal movie . wouldn not there be a lot of people that would try this with little hope of working just to get the dough ? if you have a 1 100 chance and it costs you $ 10mil , then you might pay some stooge a few grand to be your lucky hero . just send up a few dozen and 1 is bound to survive enough to make you rich . dong

3			space			 morbus meniere is there a real remedy ? it would be nice to think that individuals can somehow beat the system and like a space explorer , boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure . unfortunately , too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the cure questionable when applied to all sufferers . this applies to both medical researchers and non medical individuals . just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure all . what about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials ? did they have any guarentee of cures ? are they any less because they didn not trumpet their story all over the world ? as a parting note , wasn not there some studies done on gingko seeds for meniere's ? to the original poster what about trying for a trial of that ? it's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort . and you would be helping answer the question for future sufferers . gervais

5			union	soul	bible	scripture	jesus	spirit	existence	nature	relationship	church	christ	apostle	state	god	adam	paul			 fragmentation the primary problem in human nature is a fragmentation of being . humans are in a state of tension , a tension of opposites . good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind . the bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being . the warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against god , which is described so vividly in the pages of the scriptures . man was created with the order to become a god . those were the words of st basil in the fourth century . what he was trying to say was that god created man to be a partaker of the divine nature . in the eastern orthodox church , this is called theosis , or deification . one can also say that man was created to be whole , i.e. spirit , soul , and body operating in unison . the story of adam and eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness . theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other , the world , and the creator . that innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed god , their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves . immediately , guilt and fear was manifested in their lives . they become bound to hardship , toil , and suffering . this is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state . the beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness . if it were to receive this self awareness , the knowledge of good and evil , its paradisiac state would also be destroyed . was it the intention of the creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth ? or was the gaining of self awareness carefully staged by god , who did not desire that his masterpiece , mankind , be a blissful idiot ? god must have known that , for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value , he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites . there is no other way to achieve union with god . jesus christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities . he was the perfectly integrated individual , reconciling the opposites , and making it possible for us to be integrated , i.e. to become god , not in his essence , but in his energies . the opposites is the christian problem . the apostle paul describes it with the utmost precision in romans 7 15 24 . and he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25 . mark

5			suicide	state	crime	atheist	punishment			 death penalty was re political atheists ? in responding to dave first with official a . a nickname fuller  . the death penalty is a deterrent , dave . the person executed will never commit a crime again . guaranteed . that means that it is an effective anti recidivism measure . it does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place . the true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering . or commiting treason are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the usa ? that is , if there were no death penalty , would its introduction deter a would be criminal from committing her his crime ? i doubt it . this is only the first step . even if it were a strong deterrent short of being a complete deterrent i would reject it . for what about the case of the innocent executed ? and even if we could eliminate this possibility , i would reject the death penalty as immoral . this makes me something of a radical on the issue , although i think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me , but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make . i would , if magically placed in charge , facilitate state aided suicide for criminals who have life sentences . this could be a replacement for capital punishment . those who don not want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this option . scott sauyet
2			pitching	inning	game	roger	team	season	pitcher	brave			 reason for giants june swoon giants off to a fast start the giants have won 8 of their last 10 games behind some solid pitching excluding that 13 12 win against atlanta . if they can stay around first place after say the first 50 games , i think they have got a legitimate chance at winning the pennant and maybe even more than that .  don not you remember that the giants were in 1st place as late as june last year ? then their pitching collapsed . their problem is they have optimistically only 2 3 good starting pitchers swift , brantly , and the bowler can not remember his name ; the other starters are extremely unreliable and often get blasted before 4 innings . that means the already shallow bullpen gets over worked . this means after a few months , the bullpen collapses and their post all star record tends to be much worst than their pre all star record the bowler is john burkett , who went to 4 0 last night . he is a bargain pickup on my roto team , i got him at a minimum of $ 5 . just a thought . does someone have the won lost pre post allstar records for the giants the last few seasons ? i bet their records tends to be worst and worst as the season goes on .  this is not really true . excluding last season , the giants has been a better 2nd half team . in 1991 , they had a hot august to pull to within a few games of the braves and dodgers before fading in september . the giants may go back to earth , but not as fast as last season for two reasons 1 barry bonds 2 roger craig is no longer the manager . dusty can manage his pitching staffs much better than craig . edward hui
5			concept	being	god	heaven	street	christian	fire	testament	james			 hell i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven knowing that even one man would spend his eternal life being scorched for his wrongdoings . stephen , i suspect that when you and i use the word hell , we have different concepts in mind . when you encounter references to heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets , i trust that you do not suppose or suspect christians of supposing that the golden streets are to be taken literally , still less that they are what the concept of heaven is all about . why then should you suppose that about the fires of hell ? have you read the novel atlas shrugged ? do you remember the last description of james taggart , sitting on the floor beside the ferris persuader ? this comes close to a description of what is meant by hell in my circles . if the image of fire is often used in this connection , there are two reasons that occur to me . the first reason is that it conveys the idea of hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of james taggart but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read atlas shrugged , a smaller audience than those who have played with matches . the second reason is the history of the hebrew word gehenna , one of the words translated hell in the new testament . it refers to the valley of hinnon , outside jerusalem . in early days , it was a place where the canaanites offered human sacrifices burned alive to molech . later , it was made a garbage or refuse dump , where fires burned continually , consuming the trash of the city of jerusalem . to be cast into gehenna or to burn in gehenna thus became a metaphor for to be rejected or discarded as worthless . lest you think that identifying hell with the fate of james taggart is my own private fancy , i commend to you the book the great divorce , by c s lewis . it discusses heaven no harps and hell no flames . it is shorter than atlas shrugged , and available at most bookstores and libraries . yours , james kiefer

4			turkish	resolution	turkey	armenia	camp	village	civilian	fire	officer	existence	arm	turk	agency	state	cross	argic	army	soldier	azeri	bosnia	greece			 turkey cyprus bosnia serbia greece armenia azeris . any concentration labor camp in turkey around 1974 or later for cypriot greeks or any greeks rather than talking nonsense like above , i will be glad to read what they got .  how can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps akgun ? living through those days at the age of 20 and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position . in 1974 , turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time . forget about internal news agencies , i haven not heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey . however , i heard adana pow camp . it was not secret and well recognized pow camp .  as for all the registered prisoners to the red cross having returned to their homes , this is your version of the story . there are cases in which prisoners who were registered , some of them even sent messages to their relatives , were not released . these are undeniable facts . i see , they vanished in turkish labor camps . turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them . is that it ? what do you think happened to them ? i thought that mia's are only the subject of rambo and chuck noris movies . seems that i am wrong .  as for their treatment being according to what convention . okay we believe you . you don not need to belive me . turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history , it has been a respected and continuous member of un since the inception of un . no body ever questioned the un membership of turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after . only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby . i know what you would say next . let me answer it before wasting anytime . yes ! un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem , especially after the 1980 coup . well , us and israel had a few too . what can i say ? i am sure during athens junta duruing 1960 74 , greeks had their own share too . closed matter today between turkish cypriots turks greeks greek cypriots . there is no more any official demand from greek cypriots about any missing greek cypriots .  where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons ? have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks mediated by gali ? there was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties . was there ? i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and international press . he keeps saying that this was no longer an issue for peace talks . also , you don not want me fish for the greek cypriot politician's words that argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greek cypriot myth . seems that there is a different opinions among greek cypriots as well about missing people in turkish custody . . your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup d eta and the invasion , 5 days , is simply not true . all the cases of missing persons i know , and i know quite a few , are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield , or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish army . i am not claiming anything . i just told you what was given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish goverment turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between july 15 and the final cease fire in late august , 1974 . this answer seems to satisfy the international community , the un , and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks . also , i am not aware of any un condemnation against turkey about any missing greek cypriot . are you ? btw , do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d eta and nobody got hurt in those events ?  as of the few photos which you refer to , there are more than a few . there are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up , but also others in the prison camp in turkey . like i said before . there is even a different opinion among greek cypriots for this myth . the officers in turkish army who governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks 8 . i hope turkish army does not have same type of morons for the security of turkiye . however , this must a good subject for a movie script . one should inform oliver stone about this .  of course , not . the justice was served well . if and when the bosnian pleas are answered , who's going to dare to ask what happens to those masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea . they are known today as eoka b masterminds were known in 1974 to everybody and are doing it openly even giving tv interviews . it may take same time as it was for the eoka b case , however , the justice will be served again .  akgun , comparing the actions of the serbians in bosnian with the  actions of  turkey in cyprus is not something i would do if i were a turk .  i thought that the serbians were the savages , the inhumane beasts etc etc.  c . akgun  michalis syrimis  if this is what you understood from the paragraph above , you better let your computer system administrator check the character conversion tables in your system . if yours are ok , i should inform mine 8 . c . akgun

4			figure	fool	proposal			 capital gains tax increase loses money in , sez  no , i m saying any long term investor the ones likely to have large capital gains would be foolish to sell in order to avoid a tax hike that a might disappear in any given year and b be overcome in a year or two by accumlated gains .  to which my response is so what ? not all people who pay capital gains taxes are long term investors . more than enough of them aren not for there to be huge blip whenever capital gains taxes get raised . i never said that everyone would find this advantageous . i said that more than enough would for the result to be readily noticeable and distort trends .  even if brett's eventual return figures were correct and they clearly weren not he would still be wrong about the cause for the 86 blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors you misunderstand . i m not trying to prove a cause for anything . merely pointing out that ted's assertion that the blip in revenues was caused by selling to avoid the tax can not be proven . 1 as ted notes , not everyone is a long term investor . one might find oneself , as i did in late 1986 , anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings . given the choice between waiting a few weeks and taking an extra tax hit or selling in december with preferential tax treatment , only a fool would choose the former . not disputed . 2 the fact that brett can now construct post hoc calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point . there was plenty of money style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to sell now and save on taxes . in case anyone missed it , there was no shortage of similar advice late last year in the nytimes , e.g . even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law as in 1986 , but merely on the assumption that clinton would raise tax rates without capping cg taxes , contrary to the current proposal . it works for any situation . if you believe the market is going up , don not sell . if believe it's not , sell . but then you would be selling anyways , wouldn not you ? so where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out ? there isn not any . ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is proof of that proposition , but i m saying you can not know that the trend of increasing capital gains revenues wouldn not account for a lot of that increase . 1986 was the height of the housing boom , remember . people were trading up like mad . it's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys , though , this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world . indeed . brett  there's nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an intellectual conviction . sean o casey in the white plague by frank herbert .

5			christ	believer	homosexuality	christian	adam	god	spirit	christianity	sinner	sin	satan			 homosexuality issues in christianity you might visit some congregations of christians , who happen to be homosexuals , that are spirit filled believers , not mcc rs ; before you go lumping us all together with troy perry .  gee , i think there are some real criminals robbers , muderers , drug addicts who appear to be fun loving caring people too . so what's your point ? is it ok . just because the people are nice ? isn not satan having a hayday pitting christian against christian over any issue he can , especially homosexuality . let's reach the homosexuals for christ let's not try to change them , just need to bring them to christ if he doesn not want them to be gay , he can change that . if they are living a moral life , committed to someone of the same sex , and god is moving in their lives , who are we to tell them they have to change ?  i think the old saying hate the sin and not the sinner is appropriate here . many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably don not hate the people . i don not . i don not hate my kids when they do wrong either . but i tell them what is right , and if they lie or don not admit they are wrong , or just don not make an effort to improve or repent , they get punished . i think this is quite appropriate . you may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here . maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through feel goodism . maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more than god . kind of like the adam and eve story . read it and compare it to today's mentality . you may be suprised .
2			hitter	play	inning			 bosio's no hitter i watched the final inning of bosio's no hitter with several people at work . after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle , someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove , he wouldn not have had time to throw riles out . yet , the throw beat riles by about two steps . i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand . does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded ? and if he failed to field it cleanly , would it or should it have been an error or a hit ? judging from bosio's grimace when the ball bounced past him , he must have thought it would go through for a hit . whether vizquel was right or wrong , he certainly made one hell of a play .   phil brown aka
5			religion	god	newspaper	passage	tradition			 a little too satanic so why do i read in the papers that the qumram texts had different versions of some ot texts . did i misunderstand ? reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world . newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion , and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real story that is , a bigger headline . let's back up to 1935 . at this point , we have the masoretic text , the various targums translations commentaries in aramaic , etc . and the septuagint , the ancient greek translation . the masoretic text is the standard jewish text and essentially does not vary . in some places it has obvious corruptions , all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy . these passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the septuagint . now , the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars first , it includes additional texts , and second , in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text in addition to fixing predating the various corrupted passages . it must be emphasized that , to the best of my knowledge , these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars , and have little theological import . the dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other ot books . there is also an abundance of other material , but as far as i know , there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the septuagint . as far as analysis has proceeded , there are also variations between the dss texts and the masoretic versions . these tend to reflect the septuagint , where the latter isn not obviously in error . again , though , the differences thus far are not significant theologically . there is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material , but so far this hasn not happened . the dss are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the ot , unlike for the nt .  c . wingate the peace of god , it is no peace , but strife closed in the sod . yet , brothers , pray for but one thing tove ! mangoe the marv lous peace of god .

3			church	state	defense	nature	crime	street	improvement	country	right	spacecraft			 philosophy quest how boldly ? originator analog sf magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few years ago . the question was , if an alien spacecraft landed in washington , d . c . what was the proper organization to deal with it the state department alien ambassadors , the defense department alien invaders , the immigration and naturalization service illegal aliens , the department of the interior new non human species , etc. it was very much a question of our perception of the aliens , not of anything intrinsic in their nature . the bibliography for the article cited a philosophical paper the name and author of which i sadly forget ; i believe the author was italian on what constitutes a legal and or moral person , i.e . a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a person . the paper was quite interesting , as i recall . this is a whole different situation . if aliens were able to get here prior to us being able to get there , one might conclude that they would be more advanced and therefore more intelegent that we are . however if we get somewhere where there is life , chances are we wont be able to communicate with them . so we will have no clue as to weather they are intelegent or not . i think you would have to be very careful here if the answer is yes . the human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures does underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges ? is terrible . the usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the culture . this may not always be wrong , but that's the way to bet . that's a good point , i hadn not thought of it that way . my question however was and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night . would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn not resolved these issues on our own ? but . your comment brings up another good question . over the years we have decided that certain cultures need improvements . the native americans is a good example . prior to our attempt to civilize them , the native american culture had very little crime , no homelessnes , no poverty . then the europeans came along and now they have those and more . if we encounter life elsewhere , do we tell them they have to live in houses , farm the land and go to church on sunday ?  have a day ,  bobo

5			newspaper	salvation	testament	street	god	meaning	adam	christ	christian	resurrection	jesus	bible	messiah	scripture			 easter what's in a name ? was re new testament double stan seanna s . m . watson asks what is the objection to celebration of easter ?  the objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it . easter or eashtar or ishtar or ishtarti or other spellings is the pagan whore goddess of fertility . therefore , your question to me is what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess ? when phrased that way i suspect or at least i would hope that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to celebrating her would be .  it is celebration of the resurrection of jesus .  no , you are thinking perhaps of ressurection sunday i think . though i m not too crazy about the word sunday , but i certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess . for that matter , stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast of first fruits . torah commands that this be observed on the day following the sabbath of passover week . sunday by any other name in modern parlance . why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured ? why jump it all over the calendar the way easter does ? why not just go with the sunday following passover the way the bible has it ? why seek after unbiblical methods ?  i don not recall a command in scripture for us to celebrate the resurrection , but it is the sole and only reason that we are christians how could we not celebrate it ?  so what does this question have to do with easter the whore goddess ? i am all for celebrating the resurrection . just keep that whore out of the discussion .  if it is only the name which is a problem , i suggest that if we are too concerned about etymology , there are a lot of words we are going to have to drop . as an aside , some terminally pc people here in ottawa want dictionaries to be altered so that there are no negative definitions associated with the word black , so as not to offend people of colour .  yes , i have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave streets with afro canadiantop . grin i still think blacktop sounds better though .  as a short person , i hope they will also remove the definition curt or surly associated with my physical description .  fine by me . and while we are at it , the left handed people are both sinister and gauche so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well .  in quebec french , the word for the celebration of the resurrection is pa ques this is etymologically related to pesach passover and the pascal lamb . so is the french canadian mostly roman catholic celebration better because it uses the right name ?  yes , that sounds much better to me . is there anyone out there would thinks that phrasing sounds worse ?  so from this i infer that there are different rules for christians of jewish descent ? what happened to there is neither jew nor greek , slave nor free , male nor female , for all are one in christ jesus ?  read the letter to philemon . now tell me , was philemon's slave returned to him ? were there different rules upon the slave than upon philemon ? how about male and female ? are there different rules that apply to them as well ? or if there is no more male and female can adam and steve get married to each other in your congregation ? yes , there are differences in form and function . but the way we come to salvation in messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life .   i am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion , as it seems repetitive , but this particular point is one that i believe is new the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name . i would like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument . words often change their meaning over time . the days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods . some christians prefer to refer to first day , second day , etc. however the majority of christians have not been persuaded . the question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word , if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different . indeed i would like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous . suppose people in general use easter to mean the celebration of christ's resurrection . postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose . they are doing their best to create a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess . it's not clear that this is a healthy thing . clh

1			mac	quadra	bus	chip	price	logic	nature	winner	swap	apple			 powerpc ruminations ; was re lciii powerpc ? hi . i own an lciii and i recently heard an interesting rumor . i heard that the lciii has a built in slot for a powerpc chip . is this true ? i heard that the slot is not the same as the pds slot . is that true ?  thanks david mirsky   well , i also have an lc iii . popping the top revealed  one socket for an additional vram simm  one socket for a 72 pin ram simm  one socket for a flat pack fpu  a processor direct slot pds identical to the lc lc ii , but with an additional set of connetions to one side for the full 32 bit data path that the lc lc ii lacked  that's it . i guess a board with a powerpc chip could be made that would fit in the pds , but that's the only place .  so , will it be possible to have a nubus or pds powerpc upgrade , or will it require a logic board swap ? it would be interesting for apple to come out with a nubus powerpc that allowed use of the cpu's 680x0 , like rocketshare . but i guess that's getting a bit fantastic !  i was wondering , since macweek reported that developers were 'seeded with powerpcs on a nubus card  also , any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed ? last i heard , the estimates were around 3 4 times the speed of a quadra in native risc mode . i heard an apple employee mumble something about the arrival of powerpc machines at a much earlier date that q1 94 , but i doubt it's true .  finally , is the powerpc developer's cd mini course available ? i saw it advertised in the developer's university calendar , and i would like to know if it's at all interesting .  sean   radius speculated , publicly , that they could provide a powerpc based rocket for existing macs . it would have the plus of rocketshare and the minus of nubus accelerators no true boot off the accelerator , nubus bottleneck to video and other i o . apple , it seems , will not compete with third parties here except perhaps for not yet available macs like cyclone , where a powerpc slot might be advertised . look for daystar and such to make powerpc accelerators . one potential problem with any accelerator , though , is that it will need a rom companion and apple has licensed only radius , with rocketshare , to use any of its proprietary code . will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of risc and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 macs . perhaps , then , we will see groundbreaking prices in mac logic board upgrades , much the same way we have seen much cheaper high performance cpus this year . first generation powerpcs , 98601s , will also hopefully have socketed cpus so that they will be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later . this should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers . if there is too much technical baggage which i doubt since the external busses are the same size width to do this , perhaps we can have cpu daughterboard , a la powerbook , as standard to facilitate better cpu upgrades . this is an area where apple has fallen far behing the intel based world . perhaps catchup is in order . by the way , last week's pc week had an excellent story on powerpc , pentium , mips r4000 , dec alpha the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future . worth reading for technojunkies . also , the latest pc has a cover story on pentium . read it , and all the other stories about how intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now . once anyone is this secure , they are due to fall . intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today especially if amd gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might . the competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle . apple users should be excited that powerpc , while not guaranteed dominance , is a guaranteed winner , even if its one of several . mark

5			belief	explanation	god	existence	morris	contradiction	advance			 islamic authority over women  i can not recall anyone claiming that god makes anyone act a particlar way , i think that you are attempting to manufacture a contradiction .  a world creator god does , the moment it creates the world . and to sayi that you can not recall anyone is even below your usual standard of a arguing .  my argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions , namely god is perfect , god is all knowing god sets the rules . the rules don not work for whatever reason . because of its omniscience , the god has known it . in advance .  deletion to say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist , is really asking too much ; you would have existence depend on grammar . all you can really say is that something is poorly defined , but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course .   it is not a question of grammar , it is a question of modelling . has been discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group . when a is contradictorily defined a does not point to an instance in reality . unless there is more information in the definition of a that allows me to find it somehow . however , when the contradictory attribute is said to be essential , ie has not got that attribute not the a i am looking for , i can conclude that a does not exist   your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary complexity . i think i know what you are implying , but i would like to see your version of this better alternative just the same .   that's quite like i predict coins falling predicted happened 1 . heads tails 2 . tails tails 3 . heads tails 4 . heads tails  i take 2 . and dismiss the rest because of the unnecessary complexity the other evidence causes .   for an easy to understand explanation of why humans believe in gods read manwatching by desmond morris . benedikt
1			dod			 tape drive problems please reply via email since this is job related  i have a colorado jumbo back up system at one of my places of employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool .  is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried ? does it simply need cleaning ?  any and all comments will be appreciated !  stephen husak   what am i trying to do , what am i trying to say , i m not trying to tell you anything you didn not know when you woke up today . depeche mode nothing music for the masses stephen r . husak univerisity of illinois does it do it to all tapes ? were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch ? the reason i ask is that i bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole . it was only on a few tapes of a set . did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels ? if you have not yet , open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base . as you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to . as you are doing it , look for a couple of little holes in the tape . these are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape . the holes are spaced a couple of inches apart . my best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker ? anyhow , if the tape has the holes , then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean . the function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes . the tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out . when the hole goes by , the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop . if the mirror is dirty or out of alighment unlikely since it is made into the case you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape . if the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good , then either the pickup or the led of the sensor system has failed or is dirty . if you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r w head assembly . if it looks clean and nothing is in its way , then the drive may need to be serviced . it is possible that the led is burned out or the sensor is out . if it is still in warranty , you might be able to send it back to cms for repair .  scott hiles standard disclaimer the opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the dod or the navy . i accept full responsibility .

5			murder	population	morality	understanding			 after 2000 years , can we say that christian morality is simple . take out some physics books , and start looking for statements which say that there is no objective physics . i doubt you will find any . you might find statements that there is no objective length , or no objective location , but no objective physics ? perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is . if we can not measure anything objectively , then the answers we get from physics aren not objective either . that's what i mean when i say there's no objective physics . sure , we can all agree that say f gmm r 2 , but that's maths . it's only physics when you relate it to the real world , and if we can not do that objectively , we are stuck . of course , this displays my blatant bias towards applied science ; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations , based on real world observations . consider , for instance , that speed of light in vacuum is invariant . this sounds an awful lot like an objective speed of light in vacuum . it's an axiom that it's invariant . but if the two of us measure it , we will get different answers . yes , we call that experimental error , but it's not really error in the conventional sense ; in fact , if you don not get any , that's an error you could argue that the value of c is objective , to within some value . but i would call that a rather odd usage of the word objective , and it opens the way for statements like murder is objectively wrong for all people , to within 1 of the total population . mathew

5			truth	jesus	christian	belief	verse	being	meaning	faith	god	punishment	religion	understanding			 is it good that jesus died ?  if you can explain to me why the death of jesus was a good thing , then i would be very glad to hear it , and you might even convert me . be warned , however , that i have heard all the most common arguments before , and they just don not convince me .  ask jesus himself . he himself said why in john 12 23 32 . it isn not a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument . read jesus's own reply to your question . john 12 24 26 most assuredly , i say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it produces much grain . he who loves his life will lose it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life . if anyone serves me , let him follow me ; and where i am , there my servant will be also . if anyone serves me , him my father will honor . why would i want an eternal life if i hate this one ? if we were created by a deity , why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us ? why would i want to live forever ? the challenge in my life is that i will die , and that i must give my life the meaning i wish it to have before that happens . my time is here and will someday pass ; i will be content to live on in the memories of my friends , and once they too are dead , then i will no longer have any reason to exist in short even if your deity does exist , that doesn not automatically mean that i would worship it . i am content to live my own life , and fend for myself , so when i die , i can be proud of the fact that no matter where i end up , it will be because of my actions and my choices . if your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this , then so be it . i would much rather just cease to exist but if your god wants my respect and my obedience , then it had better earn these ; and if it does , then they will be very strong and true . jesus gives more reasons in john 16 7 . but one obvious reason why jesus died , and as with everything else , it has nothing do with his punishment was that he could rise to life again so that we would stop doubting and believe john 21 27 . the fact that jesus rose from the dead is my hope that i too will rise from the dead . it is an obvious point . do not overlook it . without this obvious point , i would have no hope and my faith would be vanity . jesus wasn not the only one who rose from the dead i think it was osiris who did the same , as well as a few characters from greek or norse legend , if memory serves . but still why would i want to rise from the dead ? why do you want to ? why did jesus suffer in his death ? again , ask jesus . jesus says why in john 15 18 25 . that's no mystery either . the world hates him without reason . it is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus , how much we need a saviour . if your god wants to win my devotion , then it knows what it can do provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion . and why can not you , brian k . accept this ? how can you ? the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him . john 14 17 . that's precisely it . i neither see nor know zeus either , nor odin . shall i offer them the same devotion i offer jesus ? the animosity and the lack of knowledge that comes out in your twistings of robert's daily verses is very convincing testimony of the truth of john 14 17 and 16 25 . you have got to understand my point of view i see christians spouting bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition . truth is , it's not . robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply ; he just rattles them off day by day . some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality , and i point these out where i can . but even more than that , even when christians do try to explain the verses in their own words , they do so from a christian point of view , which is that every human being would want to be a christian if only he or she understood the christian message properly , and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end . here's the problem with that substitute moslem or buddhist or satanist instead of christian , and it means the same thing . christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book . but if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the real world , you have got some convincing to do . i pray and hope that i do blurt out such animosity and lack of knowledge . i am not perfect either . but regardless of that , i thank god that jesus revealed himself to me , without whom i would also be bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very person who created me and who loves me . and in my opinion , you are bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren not any , and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life . as long as you keep your beliefs to yourself , i will keep my beliefs to myself but as soon as you start waving them around , expect me to toss in my opinions , too .  brian kendig je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j ai vus ; j ose croire n etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . the meaning of life si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . is that it ends . rousseau

2			relationship	right	rider	street	town	gun	population	minority			 story behavior party !   description of a pretty rowdy sounding party  and still we wonder why they stereotype us .  erc .  whacha mean we . ifin they whom ever not hey are want to stereotype me as one that likes to drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their beautiful bodies i like that stereotype . if you were refering 'stereotype to infer a negative you noticed we didn not rape , pillage , or burn down the town . we also left mucho bucks as in money with the town . me thinks the town likes us . least they said so . lynn hall nos bros   they bein themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population ; bein the ones that regard bikers as a loud , irresponsible , irreverent , reprobate rabble . doesn not sound like they attended , though , does it ? in fact , if we riders need friends , it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from lynn's description , especially if the same crowd gets invited back to party some more year after year . sure you didn not rape and pillage it's a relief to know that you were such gentlemen but because you were not completely out of hand you justify your lesser indescretions ? some pretty distorted thinking , i should say . you seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these lesser indiscretions . if the towns people aren not ruffled by the indiscretions and the partyers aren not either , maybe the indiscretions don not amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good natured rowdiness among consenting adults . the only thing that really bothered me about the description was the knee deep empty beer cans in the street , but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they helped set up the party in the first place . if i lived there and the bikers previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation and good intentions , i would certainly rather they stick around and party than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed . oh i m sorry , i just noticed that you left mucho bucks as in money . nevermind my criticism , i was out of line . i forgot that when one leaves mucho bucks as in money their behavior is permissable , perhaps even justified . if it doesn not hurt anyone , and all the parties to the party benefit and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless , then who needs to permit or justify it ? you ? why do you need to do that ? keep in mind that themfolks are the ones that could give a $ ! when a biker gets killed , when their elected officials institute further draconian legislation helmet laws , gun controls , etc . the ones that don not respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all the rest of the time . ironically , these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that don not happen to fit the stereotype you describe . they have developed a friendly long term mutually beneficial relationship with a group of motorcyclists , and aren not as burdened with mc ignorance as is the general population because of it . need i continue ? if such a need exists , it surely must come from within . so continue to wear your stigma as a badge , but the next time you are whining about them and the effect of their values on yours , remember that it was probably the behavior of self righteous wusses like myself that kept them at bay for this long . well , you got the self righteous wusses part right , anyway . chuck rogers you might have heard i run with a dangerous crowd , we ain not too pretty , we ain not too proud , we might be laughin a bit too loud , ah , but that never hurt no one , you know that only the good die young

5			christian	context	church	being			 weirdness of early christians but recently i read peter brown's body and society . it is very well researched , and well written . but is raises some very upsetting questions . the early christians were weird even more so than today's carzy fundies . they had odd views on sex , odder views on the body , totally ludicrous views about demons , and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings . if possible last i heard , it was out of print but they were considering reprinting read barbara hambly's search the seven hills . it is historical fiction , set in rome at the time of the early church . she captures the weirdness of the early christians and yet gives glimpses of context of the society they lived in . i found it a remarkably positive view of christianity considering that the author is not a christian herself . another plus is that each chapter begins with an original source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious research . jayne kulikauskas

cryptography ? plaintext ? ciphertext ? encryption ? key ? what references can i start with to learn cryptology ? how does one go about cryptanalysis ? what is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance ? what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem ? if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable , then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice ? why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break ? what is cryptology ? cryptography ? plaintext ? ciphertext ? encryption ? key ? the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances , he didn not trust the messengers . so he replaced every a by a c , every b by a d , and so on through the alphabet . only someone who knew the shift by 2 rule could decipher his messages . a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise . cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems. cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems seeing through the disguise even when you are not supposed to be able to . cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis . the original message is called a plaintext . the disguised message is called a ciphertext . encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext . decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext . a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. the algorithms are labelled ; the labels are called keys . for instance , caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different values of n . it's natural to say that n is the key here . the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients . other people are enemies , opponents , interlopers , eavesdroppers , or third parties . what references can i start with to learn cryptology ? for an introduction to technical matter , the survey articles given in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are , in general , concise , authored by competent people , and well written . however , these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last 50 years or so , and are more abstract and mathematical than historical . the codebreakers by kahn kah67 is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid 60's . introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai44 or sinkov sin66 . this is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one . the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology . consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared . the book of denning den82 gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms , database security , access control , and formal models of security . similar comments apply to the books of price & davies pri84 and pfleeger pfl89 . the books of konheim kon81 and meyer & matyas mey82 are quite technical books . both konheim and meyer were directly involved in the development of des , and both books give a thorough analysis of des . konheim's book is quite mathematical , with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems. meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods , especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks . the books of rueppel rue86 and koblitz kob89 concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography . how does one go about cryptanalysis ? classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning , application of mathematical tools , pattern finding , patience , determination , and luck . the best available textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie1 . it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is , for the most part , gained through the attempted solution of given systems. such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still classified . modern public key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer , or taking a discrete logarithm . these are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems. what is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance ? in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f , you can find x by trying every possible x . that's brute force search . example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext , but doesn not know the key . he can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key , until the ciphertext matches or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext , whichever is faster . every well designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute force search is impractical .  advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical . for example , des , which has been in use for over 10 years now , has 2 56 , or about 10 17 , possible keys . a computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid 70's . the situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation . massively parallel machines threaten the security of des against brute force search . some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar91 . one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute force search of some manageably small space of possibilities . what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem ? the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret . a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace , as mentioned above . the unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key , the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key , the system is probably strong . a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see , for example , cae90 .  a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks . a system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect . if a system passes all the tests mentioned above , is it necessarily strong ? certainly not . many weak cryptosystems looked good at first however , sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof . if joe can break this system , then he can also solve the well known difficult problem of factoring integers . see part 6 . failing that , it's a crap shoot . if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable , then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice ? cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical cryptanalysis the enemy doesn not have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext . for instance , he might assume cribs stretches of probable plaintext . if the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message . or he might exploit isologs the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys . thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn not have a chance . sometimes , cryptosystems malfunction or are misused . the one time pad , for example , loses all security if it is used more than once ! even chosen plaintext attacks , where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key , have been employed . see kah67 .  why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break ? some don not know any better . often amateurs think they can design secure systems , and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do . and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system .

5			prophet	wing	christian	passage	nature	bible	god	figure			 nature of god re environmentalism and paganism in a previous article , michael covington says that is not necessarily unorthodox . when christians call god father , we are using a metaphor . the bible in one place refers to god as being like a mother . god is neither a father nor a mother in the literal sense ; god has some of the attributes of both ; the father metaphor is usually used because for most people at most times it is the less misleading of the two possibilities . i don not know which passage you are refering to , but the passage i have often seen cited as an example of a mother image of god is isaiah 49 15 can a woman forget her sucking child that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb ? even these may forget , yet i will not forget you .  this passage is not a mother image of god at all . the mother here is the image of the best human constancy can show , and it is contrasted with the constancy of god . the mother figure here represents mankind , not god .   mark baker the task . is not to cut down jungles , but to irrigate deserts . c . s . lewis  luke 13 34 o jerusalem , jerusalem , killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you ! how often would i have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings , and you would not ! clh

4			state	massacre	civilian	target	village	troop			 deir yassin arab civilians did die at dir yassin . but there was no massacre . first of all , the village housed many armed troops . nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this . it does not appear in several long published accounts by irgun participants . even some irgun propagandists do not make this claim . secondly , the irgun and stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians . several members of the irgun attacking party , including the leader , deposited personal declarations in the irgun archives jabotinsky institute , tel aviv which state that the lehi proposed to liquidate the village after the conquest . it seems the begin overruled this plan , however the willingness of many of the attackers to seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive character evidence . the village was attacked only for its military significance . the haganah tried to get the irgun to attack a village with real military significance , but it was considered too hard the soft target of deir yassin was chosen instead . in fact , a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin . there was intention probably originating with begin to give such a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before reaching the village . everyone knows that . by all rational standards , dir yassin was not a massacre . by all rational standards , you should be posting from b cpu . the killing was unintentional . the village housed arab snipers and arab troops . thus it was attacked for its military significance . it was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians . a lie repeated is still a lie . to even compare dir yassin , in which some 120 or so arabs died , to the holocaust is absurd the irgun did not want to kill any civilians . the village had almost 1000 inhabitants , most of whom survived .  harry . brendan .

4			minority	tank	citizen	target	weapon	population	building	amendment	regulation	condition	militia	arm	facility	gun	defense	nature			 the usual yes , i am pro gun , and yes , i do disagree with this statement . nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous . radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium , as well as the tritium in the weapon , tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things . can you say neutron flux ? can you say , i get more background radiation from living in denver or having an office in a limestone building than i do standing next to a power reactor at full power or standing next to a nuclear warhead that is armed ? look up shielding in your dictionary . you don not need six feet of lead to make decent shielding ; your dead skin cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles , and neutrons are slowed by mere water . what do you think 75 of you is ? but whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself . mostly , that means water turning into harmless heavy water . but some neutrons would also hit bones , and the resulting harmfull , secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades . i think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard as for a shielded warhead , i think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded e.g. storage in a dry , temperature regulated facility , etc . for private ownership to be unregulated , i think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon , but keep it in a safe condition . if any random private citizen could not properly keep , maintain and store a nuclear weapon , then some regulation is clearly appropriate . plus these things have no self defense purposes . it's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use low yield weapons or at worst for industrial target obliteration translation cities and population centers . if the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal government , they are indeed useful weapons to the militia . i disagree with this purpose the job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community . if you look at the american revolution as an example , the militias won by seperating themselves from , and becoming independent of , a repressive government . they didn not overthrow it , and those communities canada and england , for example that didn not defend themselves were still under that same old regime . if the role of the militia were offensive , to go out and destroy repressive governments , nuclear weapons might be appropriate . but their jobs is defensive , and nuclear weapons aren not suited for that . there is also the question of personal and collective arms the second amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms. but it isn not clear if it covers other arms. certainly , not all members would supply for example a tank , only a few could or if they were to be used effectively should . however , those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower . the militias , as the framers envisioned them , were extremely democratic if only 50 of the members supported the cause , only 50 would respond to a muster , and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced . militia firepower and the popular will were , therefore , linked . but if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower in the form of heavy weapons this would all change the militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority , not of the general public . worse , that minority would be quite different from the general public at the very least , they would be much richer . as a result , i think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower his personal weapons , and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower . frank crary cu boulder

3			industry	doctor	vitamin	belief	condition	infection			 teenage acne my 14 y o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose . i bought him clearasil face wash and ointment . i think that is probably enough , along with the usual good diet . however , he is on at me to get some product called dalacin t , which used to be a doctor's prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter . i have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for dalacin t , or that clearasil is ok . i had the odd spots as a teenager , nothing serious . his father was the same , so i don not figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring . but i know kids are senstitive about their appearance . i am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin a from acne treatment . i want to help but with appropriate treatment . of teenage cradle cap . any pointers advice on this ? we have tried a couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to make the condition worse , not better . shall i bury the kid till he's 21 no . i was one of the lucky ones . very little acne as a teenager . i didn not have any luck with clearasil . even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry . frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help . getting the scalp thing under control might help that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out . taking a one a day vitamin mineral might help . i have heard iodine causes trouble and that it is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from . i notice grease on my face , not immediately removed will cause acne even from eating meat . keeping hair rinse , mousse , dip , and spray off the face will help . warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads . body oil is hydrophilic , loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance . that's why hair goes limp with oilyness . becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery . any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections , the red spots of pimples . usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won not be an infection afterwards . tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost even that of causing more pimples . jackie
5			minority	victim	murder	concept	logic	concern	atheist	punishment	liberty			 political atheists ? i think that about 70 or so people approve of the death penalty , even realizing all of its shortcomings . doesn not this make it reasonable ? or are you the sole judge of reasonability ? aside from revenge , what merits do you find in capital punishment ? are we talking about me , or the majority of the people that support it ? anyway , i think that revenge or fairness is why most people are in favor of the punishment . if a murderer is going to be punished , people that think that he should get what he deserves . most people wouldn not think it would be fair for the murderer to live , while his victim died . revenge ? petty and pathetic . perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic , but your views are in the minority . we have a local televised hot topic talk show that very recently did a segment on capital punishment . each and every advocate of the use of this portion of our system of jurisprudence cited the main reason for supporting it that bastard deserved it . true human compassion , forgiveness , and sympathy . where are we required to have compassion , forgiveness , and sympathy ? if someone wrongs me , i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed , or a similar situation is forced upon him . if someone kills another , then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn . is not our entire moral system based on such a concept ? or , are you stating that human life is sacred , somehow , and that it should never be violated ? this would sound like some sort of religious view .  i mean , how reasonable is imprisonment , really , when you think about it ? sure , the person could be released if found innocent , but you still can not undo the imiprisonment that was served . perhaps we shouldn not imprision people if we could watch them closely instead . the cost would probably be similar , especially if we just implanted some sort of electronic device . would you rather be alive in prison or dead in the chair ? once a criminal has committed a murder , his desires are irrelevant . and , you still have not answered my question . if you are concerned about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent , then why isn not this same concern shared with imprisonment . shouldn not we , by your logic , administer as minimum as punishment as possible , to avoid violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person ? keith

3			communication	police	conversation	clipper	content	key			 clipper considered harmful finally , because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments , there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications in the network for ex post facto scrutiny once some criminal act is discovered , and the instruments involved have been identified . it seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained . i can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional , since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained . imagine archiving all pay phone conversations , so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer , you can listen to all their past drug deals . and archive calls to from suspected mafia members , potential terrorists , radicals , etc. imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the world trade center bombers made in the past year . since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do , why wouldn not it happen ? ken shirriff

4			religion	context	minority	meaning	tradition	citizen	resolution	faith	believer	bosnia	february			 europe vs . muslim bosnians  please , don not be offended at this question who are the muslims in the bosnian context ? bosnian muslims are citizens od bosnia herzegovina who identify themselves with bosnian muslim cultural and religious tradition . i know that a moslem muslim is a believer in islam . islam is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world . but it is not , yes definitely not , an ethinic group . ok ! so , these bosnian muslims , who are they ? to which ethnic group do they belong ? what language s do they speak ? do they have a different language from that of the serbs or croats ? in bosnia , muslim is not merely a religious category , but an ethnic one as well . actually , here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject 1 there is only serbian and croatian nationality , and bosnian muslims are simply croats and serbs of islamic faith . 2 bosnian muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be croats nor serbs . in 1968 , argument 2 was accepted by former yugoslavia as valid , and 1 was soundly rejected . the reasons are pragmatic even if bosnian muslims are croats and serbs who converted to islam under turkish rule centuries ago , none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality . in fact , although bosnian muslims have felt drawn to croatian or serbian national allegiance , most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity . so , arguments like yes , but your ancestors were croats or serbs carry very little weight . regardless of what their ancestors might have been , as long as bosnian muslims feel that they are a separate national group , that ends the debate . what outsiders say is simply not relevant . the way the western press use the word muslim in this bosnian debacle has kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim moslem i knew from childhood was changed in the dictionary . this is just a question . no flames intended ! in the case of former yugoslavia , the date is 1971 , when muslim nationality appeared as a census category for the first time . this was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade , from recognizing bosniaks as an ethnic group 1961 to february 1968 resolution in b h declaring that muslims are a separate nation , to formal endorsement of this in january 1969 , and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of muslim nationality choice in census forms. for comparison , in 1948 census there were three national categories available to muslims in bosnia herzegovina serb muslims 71 , 991 croat muslims 25 , 295 muslims , ethnically undeclared 788 , 403 this clearly demonstrates that muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality . only a tiny minority felt able to choose serb or croat nationality . census results show that bosnian muslims have consistently opted for a third category in 1948 they chose undeclared , in 1953 they chose yugoslavs , in 1961 both yugoslavs and bosniak ethnic group , and in 1971 , 1981 and 1991 they chose muslim nationality . perhaps the term bosnian muslim nationality is too confusing for the rest of the world . but , in the present context , we are talking about muslims as nationality ; not as a religous group within some separate national identity . the reasons are mostly historical and cultural . religion plays a smaller role , as a part of culture in general , because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism . political fanaticism , yes ; religious fanaticism , no. group security and survival dominate people's thinking ; not fine points of theology . in fact , bosnia herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime . sincerely , josip

3			industry	agreement	configuration	pitch	series	cup	space	management	concept	flight	team	mechanism	union	orbit	price	engineer	clipper	committee	nasa	sector	hundred	agency	key	technology			 dc x rollout report x added forwarded by space digest original sender mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc x huntington beach , calif . on a picture perfect southern california day , mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc x rocket ship last saturday . the company hopes this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship . the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week . flight tests will start in mid june . although there wasn not a cloud in the noonday sky , the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy . the sdi organization which paid $ 60 million for the dc x can not itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle . to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub orbital dc xa , sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies . sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space based sensors and weapns . however , recent changes in sdi's political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority . today , the agency is more interested in using dc x as a step towards a low cost , reusable sounding rocket . sdio has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies , said col . simon pete worden , sdio's deputy for technology . but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program . i didn not make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend , he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters . while sdio has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective , agency officials hail the dc x as an example of the better , faster , cheaper approach to hardware development . the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments . worden said the dc x illustrates how a build a little , test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget . he said the program which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months showed how today's engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents time . the key is management , worden said . sdio had a very light hand on this project . we had only one overworked major , jess sponable . although the next phase may involve more agencies , worden said lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be crucial . it's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially . sdio's approach also won praise from two california members of the house science , space and technology committee . this is the direction we are going to have to go , said rep . george brown , the committee's democratic chairman . programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren not sustainable . nasa hasn not learned it yet . sdio has . rep . dana rohrbacher , brown's republican colleague , went further . joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team , rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency . rohrbacher , whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas , also criticized nasa air force work on conventional , multi staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology . let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top . let's build a spaceship ! although rohrbacher praised sdio's sponsorship , he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology . mcdonnell douglas , which faces very uncertain prospects with its c 17 transport and space station freedom programs , were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment . on very large ventures , companies put in seed money , said charles ordahl , mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems. you need strong government investments . while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc xa , they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development . citing corporate history , they liken the process to douglas aircraft's dc aircraft . just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc 3 transport , a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc 1 . flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance , with successive tests increasing speed and altitude . the first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering , verticle take off and landing . the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to 5 , 000 feet . the third and final series will take the craft up to 20 , 000 feet . maneuvers will become more complex on third phase . the final tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft , four legged landing . the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad , who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo 12 moon landing . now a mcdonnell douglas vice president , conrad paised the vehicles aircraft like approach to operations . features include automated check out and access panels for easy maintainance . if the program moves to the next stage , engine technology will become a key consideration . this engine would have more thrust than the pratt & whitney rl10a 5 engines used on the dc x . each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14 , 760 pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages , the a 5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on throttling capability . it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround . worden said future single stage rockets could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union . the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes . the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place . pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash , the design bureau responsible for the tri propellant and energia cryogenic engines .

3			war	police	encryption			 sorry folks read this originator .  the date i have for this is 1 26 93  note clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph . i guess this statement doesen not contradict what you said , though .  cut here  washington upi the war on drugs is about to get a fresh start , president clinton told delegates to the national federation of police commisioners convention in washington . in the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural , clinton said that his planned escalation of the drug war would make everything so far seem so half hearted that for all practical .  i just found out from my source that this article was a joke . heh heh . it seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start i just didn not notice the smiley at the end of the article , and there were a few other hints which i should of caught . well , isn not this just a hoot ! all i read on this group is a bunch of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt . this just happens to be a case of an ordinary joe netter , who decided that he would create and or distribute some misinformation . ppl buy into bs posts like this i know , because i forwarded a copy of the post to my office mate , who turned around and was although he won not admit it . sorry joe ! ready to get in a fight about f o r f e i t u r e ! please , if we are going to hold our govt which admittedly has had and still has its problems to high standards , then mustn not we follow these too ? electronic freedoms only go so far .  anyway i guess this joke did turn out to resemble clinton's true feelings at least to some extent .  sorry about that .  marc  hey , i m willing to forgive . after of course my office mate takes his extra anti paranoia pills ! doug mckee

1			cache	space	swap	vote	file	directory	windows	utility	game	link	cross	window			 save my hard disk ? allocation error , cross linked while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows 3 . 1 this evening , i got a program has violated system integrity . close all applications , exit windows and restart your computer error . gawd , i love windows 1 is there an easy way to restore everything to working order ? what might be some better approaches ? you will probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh . data files should be examined and repaired . 2 what might have caused this ? does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable ? i m suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing . you are not stupid . smartdrive caches things , and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also . all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment . the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things . a reasonably accurate prediction . here's a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file . the directory entry , the fat chain , and the data area . you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper , a sheet of graph paper , and a stack of 3x5 cards . the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name , actual size , and first cluster number . it also holds some other information that's not important right now . the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data . each square of graph paper holds a number . if the number is zero , the cluster associated with this box is available . if it holds a magic number , it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk . any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file . the data area 3x5 cards is where the actual information is stored . the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size ; storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each . in your case , one cluster is 2048 bytes . as a cluster is filled , another is allocated . to read a file , you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number . now you read the data from that cluster . next , look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read . this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file . naturally , these numbers are usually sequential , but they can jump around and even go backwards . continue reading , one cluster at a time , as you walk this chain through the fat , until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file . chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission . it doesn not have any intelligence , so you have to double check anything it fixes . now let's do a bit of a post mortem c gfx vpic46 cvpic . exe c gfx vpic46 vpic . txt c gfx vpic46 video7 . cfg c gfx vpic46 orcpro2 . cfg c gfx vpic46 vga . cfg c game goose bird2 . x c winmisc adv21 winadv . exe allocation error , size adjusted all of these files have sizes according to the fat which don not match the size reported in their directory entries . chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size . in other words , the directory entry for cvpic . exe may say the file is 64 , 877 bytes long . but chkdsk found a fat chain of 43 clusters attached to it . my numbers , obviously , are made up . 316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains . 647168 bytes disk space would be freed disk space was found which is allocated in the fat , but is not attached to any directory entry . chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files . you can then examine the files file0000 . chk through file0223 . chk and rename or discard them . or , if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files , then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat . c gfx vpic46 cvpic . exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 . c 386spart . par is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 these files are both referencing the same data cluster . obviously , one of them at least must be wrong . it's interesting to note that c 386spart . par is your windows swap file . to fix this , you should copy each cross linked file to a new name . this will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces . now delete the cross linked files . examine the copies and try to assemble them properly . good luck . hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top . 42366976 bytes total disk space 3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files 153600 bytes in 67 directories 36042752 bytes in 1496 user files 1564672 bytes available on disk your disk is pretty close to full . this may be the actual cause of the problem ; perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space . in any case , the short summary is that something trashed your fat . there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this , but you have to run them before the problem occurs . sorry .   gordon s . hlavenka vote straight ticket procrastination party dec . 3rd !   gordon s . hlavenka vote straight ticket procrastination party dec . 3rd !

5			announcement	religion	atheist	morality	format	homosexuality			 homosexuality is immoral non religious argument this was crossposted to a zillion groups . i don not intend to carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt . sex , particularly one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument . however i thought readers might be interested to know about the discussion there . clh i intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it . i intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this statement . i intend to also show that such a declaration can be made without there being a religious justification for morality , in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side , i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral , or that , collaterally , it is a morally valid practice , is free to do so . i think there are a lot of people who don not believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it . this should be fun to try and figure this out , and i want to try and expose no pun intended my ideas and see other people's and see where their ideas are standing . as i m not sure what groups would be interested in this discussion , i will be posting an announcement of it to several , and if someone thinks of appropriate groups , let me know . if someone on here doesn not receive alt . sex , let me know and i will make an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as i will use that as the main forum for this . by exception to usual policy is that i normally charge for this , but for the duration the service will be available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on internet or bitnet . i decided to start this dialog when i realized there was a much larger audience on usenet internet than on the smaller bbs networks . to give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger , this will begin on monday , may 24 , to give people who want to make the response time to identify themselves . anonymous postings are acceptable , since some people may not wish to identify themselves . also , if someone else wants to get in on my side , they are free to do so . this should be much more interesting than abortion debates !

5			citizen	doctor	birth	soul	crime	love	murder	church	god	arrogance	heaven	punishment			 christian extremist kills doctor  seriously , though , griffen didn not save the lives of children , and he did destroy the life of a man , so on the most superficial of levels , he's scum .  i almost agree , but griffen is not scum . scum has no guilt or freedom to choose anything . griffen does . god did not make scum when he made griffen . he made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong . the same goes for dr. gunn . but if you are to examine it more closely , griffen would have preferred that these children were born yet after their birth , did griffen have any assistance to offer them ? did griffen intend to support them , educate them , raise them up to be useful citizens ? did he have any intent whatsoever to help these children after birth ?  here's the real problem . americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality . if a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own , he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone . this man has fled his responsibility , has behaved like a lazy coward , and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child . however , if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden , she is not thought of in the same way . when the man abandons , the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life . when the woman abandons , the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out , and the man has no choice , and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child . ths root of this whole problem is selfishness the arrogance that says , my feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung . and when you come down to it , this is the substance of what hell is made of . it's the reason a loving god can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity . let any one of us unrepentant into heaven , and we will ruin it the first chance we get . now , i don not really know the answer to these questions , but i have got a real good guess .  and , it's probably right . and i wouldn not call that benevolent , either .  it is a move in the right direction . as it is now , we don not see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight . the media backs us completely . real responsibility does not sell . the only responsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us feel responsible without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility . we want to feel like good people , but we want nothing with being good people . just give me the freedom to say i m good , and the rest of the world can burn . rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they are dead . i will hate my brother and sister if i wish and i will cheat on my wife or husband . screw the government , because it screws me , and don not talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites . but , i m a good person . at least i admit what i do . at least i love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world not that a man lay down his life for his brother . that sounds too christian . at the root , this is the substance of what hell is made of . we have become a self indulgant , backslidden society no longer responsible to our children , to our parents , to our families , to our government , or to our god . this is the root behind justification of every evil , of every corruption in government , of every slanderous remark , of every lie , and of every murder . society cannot continue to live like this long . it will have to destroy itsself soon , and perhaps in the end , that will be the biggest blessing this world can hope to see . why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around ?   i deplore the horrible crime of child murder . we want prevention , not merely punishment . we must reach the root of the evil . it is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed . no mater what the motive , love of ease , or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent , the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed . but oh ! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime . susan b . anthony , the revolution july 8 , 1869

2			exhaust	bike			 rejetting carbs . now , i am jumping into the middle of this thread so i may not know what y all been talking about , but i have a few comments 1 . unless an engine is supercharged , the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is atmospheric . at the time the intake valve is opened , the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric . as the piston decends on the intake stroke , combustion chamber pressure is decreased , allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract . at no time does the pressure ever become negative , or even approach a good vacuum . there are a number of other factors that are very important , the three biggest being air velocity , air momentum and shock waves . velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes . at a tuned engine rpm , the stacks can greatly increase the speed , and thus momentum of the air rushing in . air momentum is critical in getting good air intake the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up stroke . shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports . shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a wall opening or closing to the air in motion . beyond this i am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves .  rich sturges h 703 536 4443 nswc carderock division w 301 227 1670 i speak for no one else , and listen to the same .

and why were there no fire engines within a mile of the compound ? because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that has a range of 3000 meters . next question . the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place . the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention . if the fbi had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults . it really was a no win situation . koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf officers . instead he ordered the murder of the children . in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the suicide murder of his other 80 followers . according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them . the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up . if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns . for all practical purposes they were unarmed , the b d followers had automatic weapons . the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely . the b d were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time . a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective , that would have been very risky , orders of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige . airplanes and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was . 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than 80 . allowing the siege to go on was not an option either , besides the serious risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period . the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege . rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon . can you think of a better way of getting the children out ? a 100 certain way ? the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story . this is simply rationalisation . it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent . that would require them to come up with a solution themselves . instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through . this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got 4 of its agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters . still the conspiracy theory is comforting , it allows them to pretend that waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis . no govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation , quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved . the blame does not rest on the fbi , it rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far , in particular the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of 4 atf agents and 17 children on his or her conscience . there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security . the fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place . the next waco may not be religious nutters but a political movement . a splinter group of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage . the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising . no other government in the world has faced such a situation . this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire . phill hallam baker

4			industry	state	relation	teaching			 professors whining about pay 2 . professors get summers off ; industry employees don not .  what professor gets the summer off ? the primary purpose of a professor at a university is to publish . teaching is secondary . the summer is when professors are able to do the research required for their papers .  i m told by my advisor that only at some universities is publishing the primary emphasis ; many professors in the cal state university system don not publish at all . those that prefer teaching are under no pressure to publish .   when discussing and issue , it helps that all participants use the same definitions , although this rarely occurs on usenet .  when i use the term university , i think of an organization that has a bachelors , masters , and phd program . i believe that cal state schools do not . i call them colleges . uc schools are universities . at a univeristy the number one goal is to publish . cal state university system offers bachlors and masters degrees . the ph . d . is not offered , because of opposition from uc . at the cal state schools , do the professors you speak of have phds ? at nearly all the professors have phds . i haven not had a professor who didn not , though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an m . a . a friend had an instructor who didn not have a degree at all , but because he had been minister of culture for the black panthers , he was teaching anyway . he had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class , and finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him to show up to teach . a university you have professors with phds and then teaching assistants tas . tas were the slave labor , graduate students who got their tuition paid , and a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt work . the professors taught the lectures , with 100 to 500 students per class , then the tas taught the labs , with 20 to 30 per class .  tim fogarty at sonoma state university , typical class size is 20 to 30 per class . teaching is definitely more the goal , and sometimes , it actually happens . the best professors at sonoma state u . are equivalent to the best professors i had at ucla and usc .  clayton e . cramer uunet , pyramid ! optilink ! cramer my opinions , all mine ! relations between people to be by mutual consent , or not at all .

5			mary	girl	god	education	doctrine	james	revelation	priest			 bernadette dates  mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes . she referred to herself as the immaculate conception . since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine , the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine . bernadette was 14 years old when she had her visions , in 1858 , four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the pope .  yours , james kiefer i forgot exactly what her age was but i remember clearly that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not have any education , whatsoever , at the age of the apparitions . she suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort . she had to ask the lady several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so . for several instances , the priest did not get an answer since bernadette did not receive any . one time , after several apparitions passed , the lady finally said , i am the immaculate conception . so , bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking . so , when she told the priest , the priest was shocked and asked bernadette , do you know what you are talking about ? bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest the priest continued with , how did you remember this if you do not know ? bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest . the priest knew about the dogma being four years old then . but bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of our lady to bernadette . note this lady of lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims. at the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water flowing . marida . spreading god's words through actions . mother teresa

4			heaven	territory	police	country	war	state	right	village	assault	mr.	population	game	resident	citizen			 banned game ?  no , it's an example of things are nowhere near as bad as you characterize . the united states police kill as many blacks as israel kills palestinians , even though the us black population , while admittedly larger , isn not engaged in a civil war to attempt to destroy the government .   this probably should not be in this newgroup but mr frank is wrong to use words like civil war or destroy the government in discussing the conflict in the occupied territories . re the newsgroup followups set to talk . politics . mideast where this belongs . this may make the term civil war dubious , but it does nothing to the phrase would estroy the government . an occupying government is still a govern ment , and the palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don not con fer citizenship which is your own determination of the distinction but to wipe it out entirely and , not incidentally , the entire jewish population it rules with it . this is an intent to would estroy the government , no matter where the government happens to be from . if the current government in isreal would be willing to let all adult individuals who are capable to vote in elections within the defacto boundaries of the isreali state , a requirement for being called a democracy in my opinion , wasn not a requirement for democracy in athens . for that matter , isn not a requirement for the term democracy in the united states , which doesn not let non citizens vote either . both the united states and israel have processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship , with a great deal of effort and a modicum of screening it's just that it isn not automatic for living in the territories . it isn not automatic for living in new york , either . that said , suit yourself . having never considered democracy the ultimate in good in this world , i could care less if you feel like calling israel , or america , or anywhere else , a democracy . personally , i withhold the term from israel for the same reason i withhold it from britain . the parliamentary system is a serious handicap . then mr. frank would be correct . as the current government neither is willing to enfrachise the vast majority of individuals in the territories or to allow these people to have the right to self determination it is not a civil war or their government , rather it is resitance to a foreign occupier . again , suit yourself . in which case israel is not attacking its own people , it is fighting a war on foreign soil , in which case the residents are entitled to play rough , yes but israel's allowed to get just as rough , within the bare limits of the rules of war . this includes , among other things , the right to shoot or bomb anyone a national of the coun try in question who is fighting them which permits mass frontal assault on all rock throwers , along with the right to take out any installation of military importance certain villages with too good fortifications can be handled by aerial bombing , as can waterways since they count as supply constitutes a government that they can lay hands on if hamas is trying to set up as the ruling party , let them beware . if this is not the scenario you want , i recommend you go back to calling it a civil war . civil wars have to be handled nicer . you cannot say the palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign nation and still call israel a government who is treating its own people cruelly . if the palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country , so is israel , and the gloves come off . naomi  yes , it is bread we may the source of peace fight for , but we fight naomi rivkis in the heavens bring peace for roses too . to us , and to all israel .

turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians , could find asylum . these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries . 1 the turks , who are a conquering nation , did not turkify the nations that came under their rule ; instead , they respected their religions and traditions . it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule . because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today popescu ciocanel . turks rule over people under their administration only externally , without interfering with their internal structures . on account of this , the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries . 2 . human beings hate each other on account of religious differences . this flaw is older than islam and christianity . but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion . if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too , or if it did not keep translating itself into action , many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy ! a . de mortraye . 3 turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition . on the contrary , it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism . if you look into history , you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years , and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians , especially that of the orthodoxes . no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens , even today . in turkey , however , if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities , local courts immediately take them under their protection . in that vast and calm country of the sultan , all religions and nations are living together peacefully . although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue , it does not replace them . because of this , the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon . in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the open air ceremonies of this sect , neither does any law imprison its cross in the church . while the dead are being taken to the graves , a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns . when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the eucharist celebrations , chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners , a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the turks to stand in respect around the group of priests . a . ubicini . 4 1 ah . djevat , yabancilara gore eski turkler , 3rd ed . istanbul , 1978 , pp . 70 71 . 2 ibid . p . 91 . 3 ibid . pp . 214 215 . 4 ibid . pp . 215 216 . serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ohanus appressian 1919 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . sahak melkonian 1920

1			resolution	nature	windows	graphics	engineer	communication	configuration	bmp	font	representative	figure	microsoft	electronics	bitmap	price	god	apps	ibm	winner			 summary canon bj200 vs . hp deskjet 500 hello again , about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers . specifically , a comparison between the canon bj200 bubblejet and the hewlett packard deskjet 500 . many people asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and email i received . below is my original query and the responses i received . i have not deleted any part of the responses , only the headers and signatures , so you can extract what you find necessary . some people asked me for an unbiased account ; however , the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments , you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer . there are a wide range of comments , each has its own value . there was no clear winner , some like the bj200 especially its price performance ratio , others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background . two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention , a new printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year around summertime , and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet . you will find that after the initial purchase , the costs of re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer . no one mentioned approx . how many sheets each ink cartridge will print , but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 1500 sheets laser printers will do 4000 5000 sheets per toner cartridge . well , that's a brief research summary of my personal research . enjoy !  hello fellow netters .  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase , the canon bj200 bubblejet vs . the hp deskjet 500 . i thought , rather than trust the salesperson , i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential . and , i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson .  now , i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs . the hewlett packard deskjet 500 300 dpi . which is faster ? is there a noticeable print quality difference , particularly in graphics ? which will handle large documents better 75 pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here ? which works better under windows 3 . 1 any driver problems , etc ? cost of memory , font packages , toner cartridges , etc ? basically , your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable , both good and bad .  well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their $ 50 rebate program on that printer it ends 5 31 , and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of $ 325 couldn not be beat anywhere i looked , and i think it's a hot printer . just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode . i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my bj 200 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj 200 . printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj 200 which is amazing considering that the hp has 2 . 5m ram installed . i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows . i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office , and two other engineers placed their orders too . if you need cdw's phone number , it's 800 598 4239 . delivery to ny was two days . good luck ! craig witkowski , motorola communications & electronics incorporation glen rock , nj  i own a deskjet 500 . performance isn not spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen . quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on 'standard photo copy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality would istinction type paper things look better . for most applications i find copy paper fine still better than dot matrix . comes with a windows driver , which seems to by pass print manager , has a few intelli fonts which are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype but haven not really tried them out . can get ram & font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldn not bother . the ram cartridges can not be used as buffer soft fonts only . for graphics , i.e. bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver . there a number of dither options such as scatter , pattern etc. the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed . text is not so good in this mode . problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text . the range of tones for graphic images isn not brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general . from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects . however , a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson . this printer is faster , cheaper , and capable of producing laser like quality on normal copier paper . can not remember the model , lx something i think ? i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here . the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand .   about a month ago , i got a canon bj200 . i absolutely love it . it is incredibly fast , except for printing from pspice i don not know if you ever do stuff with that or not . most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text . the only problems i have had are printing headers footers the printer freaked out , and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks . normal copy paper works great with it , you can only tell it's not laser printed by holding it , oh , less than twelve inches from your face . that is , if you are nearsighted , like me ! the printer comes with its own driver for windows 3 . 1 ! i have no other complaints . the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that haven not written a driver for it yet . the teeny weeny footprint is a real plus , too and , if you purchase it between now and may 31 , you get a $ 50 rebate from canon ! i bought mine from a store called compusa , and the price now is $ 340 . i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at . it also prints very well , and everyone has drivers for it , but it is very slow ! hope i helped ! 360dpi sure looks great ! heather stehman  in message hello fellow netters .  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase , the canon bj200 bubblejet vs . the hp deskjet 500 . i thought , rather than trust the salesperson , i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential . and , i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson .  various questions deleted  well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their $ 50 rebate program on that printer it ends 5 31 , and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of $ 325 couldn not be beat anywhere i looked , and i think it's a hot printer . just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode . i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my bj 200 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj 200 . printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj 200 which is amazing considering that the hp has 2 . 5m ram installed . i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows .  i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj 300 at work and a deskjet 500 at home . i prefer the deskjet . the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home . the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications . the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be the case for a long time . the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper , the deskjet is quieter , and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs . just my $ 0 . 02 worth .  mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto po box 174 luling , la 70070 internet address  yes , there is the landscape mode printing problem , but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation . i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note . the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately . 5inch around the paper the bubblejet does not . you are right about the graphics resolutions , i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect , harvard graphics , wingif , paintshop pro , and paintbrush and could not tell a difference . in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down . the bubblejet did not . i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there . finally , i wanted sheet feeding . in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately $ 100 more than the deskjet . i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money . btw , i am replacing the bj 300 with a deskjet 500 at work this month anyway . regards mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling , la  i spent some time comparing the two . we ended up getting the bubblejet bj 200 versus the hp . our reasons were 1 the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon 2 360dpi versus 300 we felt we could see the difference 3 price canon has a $ 50 rebate program going on at the moment . the bj 200 was our choice over the bj 10ex we could have 100 pages in the bj 200 feeder . the bj 10ex holds only 30 pages , i think . as you can see , up to 100 pages on the bj 200 . we haven not done anything big with the bj , but its performance seems reasonable under windows . i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer , but i don not know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canon's whereas i don not know where the microsoft bbs one comes from microsoft ? hope this helps .  thomas v . frauenhofer , wa2yyw , . uunet ! uupsi ! cci632 ! tvf , mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself !  altough i m sometimes also a salesperson if i m not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the bj200 . the printing quality is a bit better , but you you have got much more possiblities . don not forget the hp engine is at least 2 years on the marked , the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like e.g. the epson ones is quite recently available . now , i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs . the hewlett packard deskjet 500 300 dpi . which is faster ? is there a noticeable print quality difference , particularly in graphics ? which will handle large documents better 75 i have seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers 2 times the same picture , one printed with the bj200 , one with the canon , the other with the hp , and . there was a difference in printing quality , the canon was a bit better . greetz , kris  when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers . they have near laser quality , speed , and they are quiet . we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj 200s . i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality . the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder , however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal . anyway , we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well . out of 15 deskjets and 4 bj 200s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp . nate  whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say , pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt . i have been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so i have done this a few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers . i can not remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top . i bought the 500c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that . although i haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result . i note that even though you can now get the 550c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge , the 500c and 500 are still readily available at least in the uk . the following are my views experience 1 . i don not know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio . 2 . i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes they have the expertise . 3 . the 500c is worth the extra . operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows . 4 . i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down ! and i can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor . 5 . the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers . 6 . if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it's pretty slow with it , god knows what it's like without ! i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it's not in daily use . i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate . hope this is of use . regards david  just bought the bj 200 . i thought the price couldn not be beat $ 329 , with $ 50 rebate thru 5 31 and so far it is comparable , even superior , to the deskjet in print quality . speed per page rate seems to be faster i don not have figures . i don not print long docs , though . quality i think the graphics quality is excellent . print quality is excellent as well , unless you use small fonts and hold it up close ; you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet . the 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page print head in place , i would imagine . large docs not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages . manual says up to 100 , though . haven not tried it . drivers no problems under win3 . 1 yet . winword doesn not want to print the envelopes the same way the canon does , though . know nothing of add on costs . daniel a . hartung ask me about rotaract  the deskjet is slow . this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned . i have no idea how the bubblejet compares .  the interface between win3 . 1 and the printer is just dandy , i have not had any problems with it . i just bought a bj 200 printer a couple of days ago . i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp wasn not for me . the bj 200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality . i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper . i don not have problems with the ink not being dry , it seems to dry very fast probably within a second . since canon is giving a $ 50 rebate until the end of may , it is really a good buy .  sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications  wow , it's funny you should ask this . i m a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late . i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night . i was really worried that i wouldn not like it but the print quality , and noise level is fantastic ! i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality . you can not tell it's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page . no problems with drivers . the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldn not findi it under windows or wordperfect . it works well under both . i have yet to install word for windows so don not know how it works with them . i had a deskjet 500 at work last year . it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow . and much noisier than the bubblejet . i won not say the bubblejet is much better , but i really do like it more . just my $ 0 . 02 worth . brett   sincerely , robert kayman or in theory , theory and practice are the same . in practice , they are not . you mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision revised ? !

2			run	play			 apology for article but it is subject to all kinds of bias , and is almost completely useless for first basemen . from the raw stats , there is no way to tell which of a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders , and which were made on his own plays ; likewise , you can not tell whether a double play was 6 4 3 or 3 6 3 . fielding runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays , only for assists and errors . but ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way . range is not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman . the ability to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the dirt , stretching for others , and so forth is important . thus , putouts do provide some information . maybe what we need is a comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the first baseman vs . how many he actually got .  jim mann stratus computer

3			cryptography	nsa	pgp	crypto	directory	agency	key			 powerful similarity too a unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp . agrep 2 . 0 . 4 a fast approximate pattern matching tool cs . arizona . edu in directory agrep agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options . the one most obviously applicable to cryptography key selection is to be able to specify the similarity of matches in the data . for example say you make up a password phrase of qimwe7l . of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list but how close is it to en entry that could be varied by some crack program to brute force search for it ? you use agrep to find out . looking with argument for none , one or two errors , no matches . good so far . but agrep 3 qimwe7l bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern qimwe7l is too close to the pattern imsel part of himself and a host of others , to be of any cryptographic value as a key . an error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like teh for the . a minimally acceptable password would have to pass as least level 3 in order not immediately ruled out as even a remote possibility of being a good password in real cryptographic use , my personal passphrases clear at least level 8 on my rather large 80 meg word and phrase lists . and for searching for key words in human typed data lots o typos the tool is unexcelled . for example , for example , say i want to find out what people think about gibson's sf book neuromancer in the huge sf lover's archives . even with an error distance specification as small as of 1 i will find all those people who think the title was necromancer or other common typos . why miss anything ? also , the program can look for up to 30 , 000 patterns in parallel at boyer moore sublinear speeds . great for a nsa wannabe to look for your name , terrorists names , special tagalog or religious words , etc. in the news or email spool directories . you can even search for ciphertext by using , say , 30 , 000 random three byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don not score the x chi square birthday hits on message size y . you think some crypto terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you ? no problem . try agrep p nsa to find nsa , national security agency , nsecag , no such agency , national scrabble association , n s a , etc. you can also specify fixed areas looking for license plate xyz123 when you know that the letters are correct , you might say agrep 2 xyz 123 licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with xyz with up to two errors addition , substitution , deletion in the number area . you can also weight the relative cost for substiutions , additions , or deletion errors . for example , when searching dna patterns for a particular protein combination , you might know that some kinds of damage cause the a nucelotide to drop out more than other errors . you could adjust for this bias by setting dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c errors . a steganographic use i even used agrep 2 steg eograp e just now to find the correct spelling ! would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe . lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext . also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the hits into a useful form . for example , agrep d from pgp ; passphrase zimmerman nsa says output the entire mail record , delimited by from that contains pgp and contains either passphrase , zimmerman , or nsa . and agrep has been measured an order of magnitude faster than the second best similarity tool publicly available . as usual , i will be glad to email the source and docs to those who reqest them by email if they cannot do an anonymous ftp . get this now . it is too powerful to stay in the hands of the nsa . grady ward , vendor to the nsa and proud of it  2ef221 15 e2 ad d3 d1 c6 f3 fc 58 ac f7 3d 4f 01 1e 2f

5			truth	prophet	bible	jesus	belief	notion	verse	being	spirit	christ	paul	faith	lord	james	writing	existence	church	revelation	apostle	god	testament	heaven	scripture			 reason vs . revelation  i can only reply with what it says in 1 timothy 3 16 i m not here to discount parts of the bible . rather , i m here only to discount the notion of revelation . the author of 1 timothy told what he thought was the truth , based on his belief in god , his faith in jesus as the resurrected son , and his readings of the old testament . but again , what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information , given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit .  first of all , the original poster misquoted . the reference is from 2 tim 3 16 . the author was paul , and his revelations were anything but at best second hand . and is came about that as saul journeyed , he was approaching damascus , and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him ; and he fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to him , saul , saul , why are you persecuting me ? and he said , who art thou , lord ? and he said , i am jesus whom you are persecuting , . acts 9 3 5 , nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus ! pretty cool , eh ? he became closely involved with the early church , the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth . now , you may say , the holy spirit revealed these things unto him , and we could go into that argument , but you would be hard pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists . i agree . i don not believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists . please don not complain about this being circular . i know it is , but really , can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural ? this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible . additionally , what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit , and still carries the chance it is not true . the spirit is part of god . how much closer to the source can you get ? the greek in 2 timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god , literally means god breathed . in other words , god spoke the actual words into the scriptures . many theologians and bible scholars dr. james boice is one that i can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god . the only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself . and to tell the truth , i have studied the bible extensively , and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books . that's what the verse taken from 2 timothy was all about . the continuity of a book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god . and as for reason , read what it says in 1 corinthians 1 18 31 about human wisdom . basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning . if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible , you would realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man . what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible ? certainly not josephus writings , or the writings of the gnostics which were third century , at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human , with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize . yet , would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise ? jesus was fully god as well . that's why i would assert that he is wise . i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible . this is unfortunate to say the least , because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god's purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself .  for your information , i was raised without any knowledge of god . by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth , i was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being . i have , though , read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly . it contains truth in it , and i consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact , i darn near idolize the guy . but there's no rational reason for me to except god's existence . please rethink this last paragraph . if there is no god , which seems to be your current belief , then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists , but he claimed to be god himself ! regards to c . s . lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus ? in conclusion , be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims. the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out . about your reading of the bible , not only does the spirit inspire the writers , but he guides the reader as well . we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit's guidance for to us god revealed them through the spirit ; for the spirit searches all things , even the depths of god . 1 cor 2 10 , nas  peace and may god guide us in wisdom .  carter c . page of happiness the crown and chiefest part is wisdom , a carpenter's apprentice and to hold god in awe . this is the law that , seeing the stricken heart of pride brought down , we learn when we are old . adapted from sophocles  other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of god breathed . it's true that the greek word has as its roots god and breath . however etymology doesn not necessarily tell you what a word means . otherwise , goodbye would be a religious expression since it comes from god be with ye . you have to look at how the word was actually used . in this case the word is used for wisdom or dreams that come from god . but god breathed is an overtranslation . clh

4			religion	german	scripture	kurd			 stop putting down white het males . btw , i m a walc white aryan lapsed catholic   d baba duane m . hentrich  i would like to go on record as objecting to mr. hentrich calling himself an aryan . the word aryan is of sanskrit origin and occurs first in the hindu scripture , the rigveda . it seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character . such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the buddha who called his religion the eightfold aryan path . the word was borrowed by the german scholar max mueller who used it as a synonym for indo european , but then the nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that aryan is synonymous with nordic which seems highly unlikely . the people who originally called themselves aryas , the iranians , noprth indians , the afghans and possibly the kurds , are none of them nordic . so the use of the word by westerners , though meant with apparent good humor in this case , is nontheless inappropriate . the only westerners who may have some claim to call themselves aryans by descent are the celts who seem to have wor shipped a god called aryaman who is mentioned in the rigveda . if you want to check what i am saying , look at mallory's book , in search of the indo europeans or , just look at the encyclopedia britannica . the reason this usage is offensive is that most of ancient indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the aryans and for westerners to butt in is really not nice , not to mention the horrible things done by germans to jews , using a word to which the germans have no clear claim . rohit parikh

3			wire	electronics	circuit	target			 optoisolator interfacing questions i am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9v to my cpu board which runs at 5 6v . the optoisolator is a 4n35 . on the led side , i put the signal i want through a 10k resistor to the base of a 2n2222 . on the transistor side , i tie my cpu input line to the collector which has a pull up resistor of 47k . it functions ok , but seems very slow . i can detect pulses that occur at about 2khz , but not much faster . isn not the rise fall time of this device , something like 5us ? i should be able to detect my target of 40khz , but i can not get 16khz . this is done using wire wrap and the wires going to the cpu and to the test pin are about 8 inches long , but i m not doing anything high speed . in the art of electronics , it mentions tying the base of the phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the speed . is that what i need to do ? how do i calculate the resistor value ?  paul malenfant pmalenfa kitkat . webo . dg . com 508 870 6460
2			meaning	bmw	manufacturer	dod	bike	exhaust			 rejetting carbs . air pump  if we are only talking about 4 stroke i think i can understand exhaust pulse affect in a 2 stroke , the intake valve is closed on the exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the cyclinder . i guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the canister . meaning would gases so far down the line the canister really have an effect on the exhaust stroke ? do the gases really compress that much ? for discussion purposes , i will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe , and try to paint a useful mental picture . 1 . unless an engine is supercharged , the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is atmospheric . at the time the intake valve is opened , the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric . as the piston decends on the intake stroke , combustion chamber pressure is decreased , allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract . at no time does the pressure ever become negative , or even approach a good vacuum . 2 . at the time of the exhaust valve closing , the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler . note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake , because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion . 3 . in the last 6 8 years , the japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning , in pursuit of almighty horsepower . at this point in time , on high performance bikes , substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance , because the stock intake system flows very well anyway . substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference , unless in general the new exhaust system is much louder than the stocker . 4 . on older bikes , exhaust back pressure was the dominating factor . if free flowing air filters were substituted , very little difference was noted , unless a free flowing exhaust system was installed as well . 5 . in general , an engine can be visualized as an air pump . at any given rpm , anything that will cause the engine to pump more air , be it on the intake or exhaust side , will cause it to produce more horsepower . pumping more air will require recalibration rejetting of the carburetor .  dave tharp dod 0751 you can not wear out mra 151 an indian scout , 88 k75s 48 indian chief ahrma 751 or its brother the chief . 75 r90s 151 72 tr 2b 751 ama 524737 they are built like rocks 65 r50 2 velorex 57 nsu max to take the knocks , 1936 bmw r12 compulsive it's the harleys that my employer has no idea . joiner give you grief .

4			car	price	state	defense	crime	country	figure	firearm	right	suicide	victim	gun			 my gun is like my american express card  i don not remember the figures exactly , but there were about 3500 deaths in texas in 1991 that was caused by guns . that includes suicides . since it has been shown in other countries that suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for doing oneself in studies include some done published in japan , canada , austria , norway , suicides ought not be included in the count . if this is done , the number of vehicle related deaths greatly exceeds that of firearms related deaths in texas . i should not suffer because of others . certainly not . we all agree on this one , but we also live in a sociaty and therefor we will have to give up some of our freedom note the . why ? unless it's doing something that directly hurts someone else , what's the point ? otherwise , you would better stop operating all motor vehicles , since the price of operating them greatly exceeds the cost in lives of firearms. one state don not remember which , texas ? tried to impose a rule that you could only buy one gun each month . think you all know what happened . well , it's been done at least twice . south north ? carolina did it a few years back . and watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country rise quite a bit . virginia just passed the law . no word yet on what the results will be , but i would be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates won not be one of them . i respect the right to defend yourself , but that right should not inflict on other people . self defense doesn not inflict on other people except perhaps the criminal who's tried to do you damage , and maybe indirectly on future potential victims who might not become victims .   some things are too important not to give away to everybody else and have none left for yourself . dieter the car salesman

5			prophet	love	right	believer	faith			 new newsgroup soc . religion . islam . ahmadiyya ? i urge you all to vote no to the formation of the news group ahmadya . islam . if they want to have their own group , the word islam shouldnot be attached to the name of such group . we don not consider them as muslims. dr. tahir ijaz comments on esam abdel rahem's statement but the problem is we consider ourself to be muslims , even though you don not . luckily , faith is determined by what one believes and is a personal matter . you cannot declare the faith of someone else . mr. jawad ali then comments on tahir ijaz's statement you are not considering the consequences of your argument . the converse would be that the problem is that muslims dont consider ahmadies to be muslims. who one considers to be one's co believer is also a personal matter . it would be just as wrong to tell the muslims who should be included in their self defination . the converse would be that the problem is that muslims dont consider ahmadies to be muslims which is a wrong statement . in the light of dr. ijaz's statement , the above statement should be corrected . is that some non ahmadi muslims don not consider ahmadi muslims as muslims so , the problem does not get solved who is a muslims and who is not ? humans cannot decide . humans may not declare others faiths . its that simple . i don not understand , why the mere use of the word islam is becomming such a big issue . i have seen numorous postings on the net on this subject , and all they say , no , no , you cannot use islam as the name of your newsgroup . i haven not seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring the name of other's faiths ? who gives them this authority ? quran ? or hadith ? or something else ? i want to know this ! just a small reminder to all my muslim brothers , did ever the holy prophet of islam muhammad pbuh , say to anyone who called himself a muslim no , you are not a muslim ! never ! i challenge all my muslim brothers to produce a single such evidence from the history of islam ! hence , if the prophet muhammad could never do that to anyone , how could the muslims , mullahs or even governments of today do it to anyone . do you consider yourself above the holy prophet muhammad pbuh ? sincerely , nabeel .  note love for all views abeel . ana hatred for none are email mine
3			flight	animation	spacecraft	space	satellite	interpretation	concept	series	facility	orbit	propulsion			 stephen hawking tours jpl jpl news software vax vms vnews 1 . 41 from the jpl universe april 23 , 1993 cosmologist stephen hawking tours lab by karre marino some 15 years after his first visit to jpl , prof . stephen hawking , lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge university and author of a brief history of time , returned to the lab april 5 . on a tour hosted by jpl chief scientist dr. moustafa chahine and merle mckenzie , manager of the international affairs office , hawking visited a variety of facilities , met with lab director dr. edward stone and various project scientists and managers , and felt like royalty , he said . hawking , whose theories attempt to explain the origin of distant galaxies , black holes and alternate dimensions , wanted to re visit jpl , he explained , because while i m most interested in those things in space that are farther away , i know that here is where the first steps are taken . hawking , who was accompanied by his family , two graduate students and his aides , began the tour in von karman auditorium , as david evans , deputy assistant lab director in the office of flight projects , and dr. arden albee , mars observer's project scientist , briefed him on current and past flight projects . voyager was pointed out to him , with special attention paid to a gold plate with a series of engraved images . should extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft , evans noted , they would find a variety of images that would explain something of earth . the professor asked if we were still communicating with the spacecraft , and evans affirmed that we are . using a model of mars observer , albee spent several minutes describing the project and the spacecraft's features . in answer to a question from hawking , chahine described a proposed drag free satellite , but confirmed that at this point , it's only a concept . chahine , who had met hawking at caltech about five years before , described the professor as a living miracle of the power of the brain . he's miraculous , and he has such a good sense of humor . the next stop , a demonstration on scientific data visualization in section 384's digital image animation lab , entertained and delighted the group , as everyone donned goggles to view 3 d images of mars . project scientist dr. eric de jong showed off the latest data a comet that had only recently been discovered in orbit close to jupiter . hawking was curious about its composition , and as he was shown how images are developed , he asked several questions on their interpretation . norman haynes , ald , office of telecommunications and data acquisition , briefed the professor on the space flight operations facility , and then hawking spoke with stone . the day ended with two technical discussions of particular interest to the professor . technical group leader dr. frank estabrook and senior research scientist hugo wahlquist described a three spacecraft gravity wave experiment , currently under way . then planetary astronomer dr. richard terrile explained the philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection . the hawking party , which had been visiting southern california for five weeks , was headquartered at caltech , and planned to leave for england within a few weeks after the lab tour . upon departing , the cambridge based scientist promised chahine that he would return to jpl for another visit .   ron baalke jet propulsion lab m s 525 3684 telos the aweto from new zealand pasadena , ca 91109 is part caterpillar and part vegetable .

5			atheist	nature	explanation	truth	pitch	theist	religion			 americans and evolution sure it isn not mutually exclusive , but it lends weight to i.e. increases notional running estimates of the posterior probability of the atheist's pitch in the partition , and thus necessarily reduces the same quantity in the theist's pitch . this is because the divine component falls prey to ockham's razor , the phenomenon being satisfactorily  explained without it , and there being no independent evidence of any  such component . more detail in the next post  occam's razor is not a law of nature , it is way of analyzing an argument , even so , it interesting how often it's cited here and to what end . it seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being primitive , simple minded and unscientific , anti intellectual and childish , and yet again condemned as being too complex occam's razor , the scientific explanation of things being much more straightforeward and , apparently , simpler . cute characterization bill ; however , there is no inconsistency between the two statements . even if one believes that religion is primitive , simple minded and unscientific , anti intellectual and childish , one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation . the ideas themselves don not have to be complex before being excised by occam's razor , they only have to add unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description . which is it to be which is the non essential , and how do you know ? i think the non essential part of an explanatory system is one that adds no predictive capability to the system . considering that even scientists don not fully comprehend science due to its complexity and diversity . maybe william of occam has performed a lobotomy , kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away . huh ? this is all very confusing , i m sure one of you will straighten me out tough .  watch it , your freudian slip is showing  mike mcangus the truth is still the truth even if you choose to ignore it .  some of the old . sig viruses are still the best
2			game	espn	pitcher	talent	roger	baseball	player	run	season	defense	peter	league			 espn and expansion i was watching peter gammons on espn last night , and he's got me a little confused .  while talking about expansion , he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players they will be facing mcgriff hitting 50 home runs , sheffield getting 150 rbi's , and glavine winning 25 games . this was , of course , all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early 60's , late 60's , late 70's .  what really confused me , though , was the mention of al players who would do well next year . specifically , roger clemens winning 25 games , and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 50 home runs .  my question is how in the hell will the rockies marlins help the al ? the last time i looked , there wasn not a lot of talent jumping leagues . did i miss something ?  only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about baseball than the average mailbox . okay , i m overstating . still , the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this year did not pitch in the majors last year . huh ? imo , this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had , since the talent was diluted over both leagues . in gammons defense , because the talent drain came from the al as well , some increase will be seen . he also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season . he's still full of it .  kurt bose as in daisy , not rose if you take out all the f ks , this is an 18 page book . wally backman , leafing though a copy of mets teammate lenny dykstra's autobiography , nails

3			candida	mechanism	yeast	disease			 thrush was good grief ! was re candida albicans what is it ? my dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous after i began taking acidophilous on a daily basis , the outbreaks ceased . when i quit taking the acidophilous , the outbreaks periodically resumed . i resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then . this is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction between real disease caused by candida albicans and the disease that was being asked about , systemic yeast syndrome . there is no question that candida albicans causes thrush . it also seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush i have never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before though presumably it would work by the same mechanism . candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major pathogen . that does not mean that there is evidence that it causes the systemic yeast syndrome .  david rind

5			right	paul	setting	apostle	lord	cup	church	god	cross	revelation			 revelations babylon ? it is also of interest to note that in 1825 , on the occasion of a jubilee , pope leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image on one side and on the other side , the church of rome symbolized as a woman , holding in her left hand a cross , and in her right a cup with legend around her , 'sedet super universum , not he whole world is her seat . you read more into the medal than it is worth . the woman is the church . catholics have always called our church holy mother church and our mother . an example would be from st cyprian of carthage , who wrote in 251 ad , can anyone have god for his father , who does not have the church for his mother ? hence the image of the church as a woman , holding a cross and a cup , which tell of the crucifxition of our lord , and of the power of his blood the grail legend , but also , more significantly , it shows that this is the cup of the new covenant in my blood , which shall be shed for you and for many . luke 22 . 20 , the cup represents the new covenant and holds the blood of redemption . the fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat , is that the catholic church is catholic , that is universal , and is found throughout the world , and the church shows the crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers , thorugh which the holy sacrafice of the mass , can be said and celebrated in all the nations as malachi predicted in malachi 1 . 11 , from the rising of the sun to its setting , my name is great among the gentiles , and everywhere there is sacrafice , and there is offered to my name a clean oblation , for my name is great among the gentiles , says the lord of hosts . and so we acknowledge what st paul wrote for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you show the lord's death until he comes . 1 corinthians 11 . 26 you are quite right about the identification of babylon the great , mother of all harlots with rome . i think we simply disagree as to what time period of rome the apostle john is talking about . andy byler

5			truth	belief	soul	tradition	mary	bible	doctrine	church	revelation	apostle	god			 question about virgin mary faris says a . faris posting deleted . the moderator replies i think you are talking about the assumption of the blessed virgin mary . it says that the immaculate mother of god , the ever virgin mary , having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . this was defined by a papal statement in 1950 , though it had certainly been believed by some before that . like the immaculate conception , this is primarily a roman catholic doctrine , and like it , it has no direct biblical support . note that catholics do not believe in sola scriptura . that is , they do not believe that the bible is the only source of christian knowledge . thus the fact that a doctrine has little biblical support is not necessarily significant to them . they believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church , and also that it can be revealed to the church . i m not interested in yet another catholic protestant argument , but if any catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs , i think it would be appropriate . clh that is generally accuate , but contains one serious error . we catholics do believe that god's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the bible can be and is passed on through the tradition of the church . it should be noted that the tradition of the church , otherwise known as sacred tradition , is not the same as ordinary human traditions . however , we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the church . public revelation , which is the basis of catholic doctrine , ended with the death of st john , the last apostle . nothing new can be added . theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously , so that the council of nicea could define statements about the theology of the trinity and the incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the bible and had been disputed before the council , but there was no new revelation at nicea or at any subsequent council . cardinal newman's an essay on the development of christian doctrine , written while he was still an anglican , is an excellent discussion of of this point . it was recently reprinted as a doubleday image books paperback with some related shorter works under the title conscience , consensus , and the development of doctrine .  marty helgesen bitnet mnhcc cunyvm internet what if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation ?

1			industry	graphics	sgi	gear			 48 bit graphics . i was recently talking to a possible employer mine ! and he made a reference to a 48 bit graphics computer image processing system . i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that . anyway , he claimed it had 48 bit color a 12 bit alpha channel . that's 60 bits of info what could that possibly be for ? specifically the 48 bit color ? that's 280 trillion colors , many more than the human eye can resolve . is this an anti aliasing thing ? or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor . i m pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific systems i.e. photo processing gear use as much as 96 bits of color info . why ? why not , oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the hardware's only task is image manipulation , and profressional photographers demand professional results . also , to settle a bet with my roommate , what are sgi's flagship products ? i know of iris , indigo , and crimson , but what are the other ones , and which is their top of the line ? sadly , i have access to none of them . just a dec 5000 25 . sigh . strange question , but anyway , there's the vgx line , the newer indigo 2 , and the onyx systems are the new big boys on the block you can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance of a reality engine . there's more , but i don not have my handy periodic table of sgi's on me . keith

4						 israeli destruction of mosque s in jerusalem   you appear to be referring to moshe dayan . how do you know that the evicted jordanians were not provided with something else ? in fact , this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did not own but received compensation for their loss , anyways ! woe to jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them by force with ethnic cleansing of any remaining jews is disgusting and shameful . does anyone have a reference to the claim that the arabs in the moghrabi district were squatters ? i haven not seen this in the books i have read . i haven not seen the opposite , either .  jim jim eggert
2			pittsburgh	cup	coach	bruin	detroit	league	game	hockey	playoff	player	state	mario	pen	wing			 don cherry help me out , here    as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesn not know anything about him , i don not know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether he's a canadian thing altogether . seriously , what is he all about ? i know he was a coach at one time , and from the volume of posts about him , someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow , but my question is , what is the deal with him ? secondly , are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait , or do people actually take him seriously ? i gotta tell you , from what i see , he really sounds like an ass . let me know maybe i m missing something .   well , here in detroit we get to see and hear don cherry quite regularly . the detroit area picks up hockey night in canada from cbc ch 9 in windsor where we see don cherry's coaches corner between periods . we also get to see don cherry's grapevine just before the game . the grapevine is a hockey talk show where don talks to a player or coach about what else hockey . it's actually a pretty good show and don isn not as annoying as he is on coaches corner . i think this is were don got his nickname grapes but i m not sure . don use to coach the boston bruins . i don not know exactly when that was . could someone fill me in on this info ? a local radio station here in detroit wllz talks to don every tuesday morning . personally , i have had my fill of donny ! he really pisses me off sometimes . during the detroit toronto game monday night on cbc , don gave high praise to doug gilmour , saying he was a two way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that . that's fine and i agree that gilmour is a good two way player but he said the exact same thing about yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show . what gives ? it seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city . don cherry i think insert star player name for city that he is in is the best two way player in the league today .  there have been other times can not remember exactly what he said that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to . someone here on the net said something about how don criticized mario lemieux but when the time comes for don to broadcast the cup playoffs from the civic center yes , i think the pens will make it out of the wales conference don will apologize left and right for his remarks about lemieux . in my opinion , he is an ass . and i won not change my opinion if i m in a different city . sorry , if this didn not answer your question better but i just had to get this off my chest  laurie marshall wayne state university detroit , michigan go wings !

4			arrogance	war	genocide	enemy	country	hitler			 the mufti again ? meanwhile they support the genocide of bosnians . let me remind all of those muslim haters out there who like to mention the mufti's cooperation with germany as a reason to let muslims be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts 1 why blame the muslims for what the nazis did and forgive italy , the croats , and many other europeans for being real allies to hitler ? 2 why blame muslims for supporting germany the enemy of their enemy at the time britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible for most atrocities against muslims in the region and forgive germany itself eventhough it is the one who created nazism ? 3 as far as muslims are concerned there was no difference between nazi germany , and antimuslim colonialist britain france in 1940 . they were all racist , anti arab , and full of arrogance and hate . wwii and the wars in algeria , sudan , and other places proved that very clearly . even anti semitism was not more spread in germany than in france or britain , it just happened to be official policy in germany . and we will forgive you , just set our countries free . so any arguments about wwii behaviour coming from the people who killed millions in that war from either side is just plain laughable . enough said .

2			concept	gear	wheel	car			 dumbest automotive concepts of all time my top 10 list of dumbest automotive concepts ever  9 . back up lights on corvette they are on the sides of the car !  sure would be interested to know what year s this was ! i don not seem to recall any car with back up lights on the sides , much less any corvette . i suppose i could be mis interpreting what you are trying to say here . just a quick comment . backup lights mounted on the side would actually be extremely useful for people backing out of parking stalls . while i can not think of any corvettes with side mounted backup lights , i know that saab started using them about 15 years ago . my 1975 saab 99 didn not have them , but a friend's 1978 saab 99 certainly did . in addition to the confentional tail light mounted backup lights , they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly . for those of you who don not remember , saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth , about the size of a national geographic magazine , sticking out of the front fender , which incorporated amber parking lights , amber side marker lights reflectors , white cornering lamps like american luxury cars aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on , and white backup lights aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear . the glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards pot holes , kid's toys , etc that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up . mart l . molle computer systems research institute university of toronto toronto , canada m5s 1a4 416 978 4928
3			symptom	doctor	explanation			 is msg sensitivity superstition ? even properly controlled studies e.g. double blind studies are almost useless if you are trying to prove that something does not affect anyone . and the mass of anectdotal evidence , combined with the lack of a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving the hypothesis , makes the msg reaction hypothesis the most likely explanation for events .  good grief ; has no one ever heard of biostatistics ? the university of washington plus 3 or 4 others harvard , unc has a department and advanced degree program in biostatistics . my wife has an ms biostat , and there are plenty of mds , phds , and postdocs doing biostatistical work . people do this for a living . really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well . anecedotal evidence is worthless . even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years , and who swear it is effective , are often suprised at the results of clinical trials . whether or not msg causes describable , reportable , documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover . the last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses , 100 doctors , and a dozen ph . ds at one university and at 70 hospitals in five nations . i would think the msg question could be settled by one lowly biostat ms student in a thesis . bruce
5			lord	belief	jesus	revelation	reasoning	love	truth	tradition	doctrine	gift	sin	writing	psalm	grace	god	notion	church	faith	mary	girl	apostle	understanding	christ			 what was the immaculate conception speaking of the immaculate conception of the blessed virgin it was a gift from god . i think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus . yes . for examples of this in the writings of the early fathers , consider you alone and your mother are more beautiful than any others ; for there is no blemish in you , nor any stains upon your mother . who of my children can compare in beauty to these ? st ephrem the syrian , nisibene hymns , 27 8 , around a . d . 370 lift me up not from sara but from mary , a virgin not only undefiled but a virgin whom grace has made inviolate , free of every stain of sin . st ambrose , commentary on psalm 118 , 22 30 , ca . a . d . 388 there are many others . as the tenets of faith developed , particularly with augustine , sin was more and more equated with sex , and thus mary was assumed to be a virgin for life since she never sinned , and since she was the spouse of god , etc. no. we have , for instance was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of holy mary , and being questioned , did not immediately add , the virgin ? . and to holy mary , virgin is invariably added , for that holy woman remains undefiled . st epiphanus of salamis , panacea against all heresies , between a . d . 374 377 . we surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine about children of mary . for the lord jesus would not have chosen to be born of a virgin if he had judged that she would be so incontinent as to taint the birthplace of the body of the lord , home of the eternal king , with the seed of human intercourse . anyone who proposes this is merely proposing . that christ could not be born of a virgin . pope st siricius , letter to anysius , bishop of thessalonica , a . d . 392 note that st augustine's conversion to christianity was in a . d . 387 . i don not know offhand when his election as bishop of hippo was , but i m quite sure it was after 392 . the belief in mary's perpetual virginity originated long before augustine's time . we hold that it originated with the apostles . strictly speaking , however , mary's perpetual virginity is independent of her immaculate conception . mary could have been immaculately conceived and not remained a virgin ; she could have remained a virgin and not been immaculately conceived . since we also had this notion of original sin , ie . that man is born with a predisposition to sin , and since mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin , she didn not have original sin . when science discovered the process of conception , the next step was to assume that mary was conceived without original sin , the immaculate conception . no. it has been held in the church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception , when a person's life begins . biology had nothing to do with it . prayerfully reflecting on the truth of mary's sinlessness , and the means by which god could have achieved this , the church arrived at the truth of the immaculate conception . thus , the immaculate conception is not a new doctrine , but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones . the celebration of the feast of the immaculate conception itself was given by pope sixtus iv 1471 84 and the feast was made a precept feast of the church by pope clement xi 1700 21 . mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes . she refered to herself as the immaculate conception . since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine , the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine . no. first of all , lourdes is private revelation , and doctrine is not based on private revelation . the most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation , which ended with the death of st john the apostle . second , the case for the doctrine was irreformably sealed in 1854 with the ex cathedra promulgation of the bull ineffabilis deus by pope pius ix . this meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma ; a dogma , by definition , cannot change and is required to be believed by the faithful . the apparition at lourdes happened in 1858 , four years later . the most that might be claimed is that lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval , but the church has never claimed that , nor shall she . in christ's peace , brad kaiser  those who trust in him shall understand truth , and the faithful shall abide with him in love ; because grace and mercy are with his holy ones , and his care is with his elect . wis 3 9 nab

2			sport	espn	country	team	war	league	season	cross	islander	flyer	nhl			 espn2 tell us about it  the problem espn2 faces is the tci cablevision connection in the merger of their prime and sportschannel networks . prime sportschannel will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the off season . also , tci and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers . tci cablevision will do their best that espn2 never gets off the ground successfully . and the nhl's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc and espn . nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local nhl nba mlb sports teams. note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners . when if cablevision vp chuck dolan's purchase of the islanders goes through , the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold their original owners were , and they have remained due to a lucrative tv contract . the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the prism pay channel . there are six teams affiliated with regional sc's , another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets , and other locals like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements . with all this cross ownership , i was surprised that espn got the deal this season ! gld  je me souviens gary l . dare go winnipeg jets go ! selanne domi stanley

5			heaven	gift	god	angel	meaning	atheist	christian	faith	christ	logic	abuse	understanding	existence	punishment			 hell here's how i talk to non christians who are complaining about hell . me do you believe you are going to heaven ? him i don not believe in heaven . me so are you going there ? him if there was a heaven , i would . me but since there isn not a heaven , you are not going there , are you ? him no. the point is that heaven is based on faith if you don not believe in heaven , there's no way you are going to be in it . hmmm . people in the americas before the time of christ , children who die young , etc . of course , the next step is , i don not believe in hell either , so why will i be there ? it seems to me that hell is eternal death and seperation from god . but of course , the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness , at the very least most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever , and never see god so they do , in fact , believe that they are going to hell . i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death , but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they are going to hell . they believe they are going to die . understand that you have turned hell into a verb . using the same logic , it also follows that all animals are going to hell . are you sure this is what you want to say ? presumably animals don not have the opportunity to get to heaven , but this still doesn not change the fact that they are going to hell die a final death i don not claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some sort , but if hell is as you described final death , and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that there will never be a moment when i am aware of my non existence . assuming i go to hell and not to heaven in other words , i will never know i m dead . hmmm . hell doesn not have to be worse than earth to be hell because it's eternal , ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill , and has died at least she's not suffering any more ; she's in heaven now . consider the following statement at least she's not suffering any more ; she's in hell now . the above statement sounds odd , but according to your definition of hell , it would be a true statement . the person in hell would not be suffering . granted , they wouldn not be anything wouldn not be having any conscious experience whatsoever . you say hell death is eternal . however , this loses its meaning to a dead person . and to me , it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity . many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda friend , do you want the free gift of e ternal life ? it's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife . can anyone back me up on this ? combined with the survival instinct all animals share . the difference is we have consciousness , and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains , we then desire a sort of super survival .  and it's a lot worse than heaven . that's the only comparison that matters . that would depend on what heaven is like . if god is a king , and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king , i might opt for hell . i read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert eskimos to christianity in the book the illusion of immortality by corliss lamont . the missionary started to speak about heaven . are there seals in heaven ? will we be able to go hunting ? asked an eskimo . the missionary said no. the group of eskimos then said something to the effect of , well what good is your heaven if there's no hunting ? scram . i highly recommend the above book ioi to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no immortality . alan terlep incestuous vituperousness oakland university , rochester , mi melissa eggertsen rushing in where angels fear to tread . pax , dana

4			waco	compound	understanding	batf	communication	fool	assault	target	aid	explanation	suicide	atf			 ax the atf a few comments on the atf's botched handling of this case 1 . attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight ? the explanation we were given at least at one point was that they thought the cult members would be at religious services . my only comment on this bit of idiocy is that if you are going to operate as a quasi military unit , you would better understand basic military tactics . one cardinal rule is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is incorrect , the operation will fail disastrously . 2 . we were told that atf got four agents killed because they were outgunned , they didn not expect such heavy resistance . when questioned about why such an overwhelming military style assault was planned , we were told that it was because the cultists were thought to be heavily armed . can you say contradictory ? i knew you could ! 3 . the batf has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant , hotdoggers . i was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and referred to them as a bunch of crockett and tubbs wannabes . i m more than ever convinced that's right on target . an anecdote not related to the waco fiasco is that apparently the batf screwed up some of the evidence in the world trade center bombing . there's now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by the fbi will not be admissible in court . this is not hearsay . i was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an fbi agent . his opinion of the batf was , ummm , well , let's just say uncomplimentary . 4 . i have still not been presented with one iota of evidence that the bd's had any of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the reason for the raid in the first place . btw , we are still hearing this justification . ag reno , on cnn yesterday , made references to this issue , without any substantiation . she also waved around the he's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children ! flag . sigh . 5 . a point re the feds in general their handling of the whole siege reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought processes of the cultists . ag reno said they pushed the button because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing . my only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to the edge , what the hell did she think their reaction would be to an hours long assault on the compound where holes were punched in the walls and cs gas pumped in ? if i were a bd , i would expect the forces of the godless government to assault me at any time . in that light , whether they torched themselves or drank jim jones kool aid is irrelevant . also , look at how the siege was conducted bright lights , loud rock music , cutting off communications and other contact with the outside . all measures designed to make the bd's feel more and more isolated and threatened . this might have been a great strategy if they were dealing with criminals . as it was , it looks to me like everything they did fed into koresh's paranoid delusions .  include std disclaimer . h dan s .

5			marriage			 ancient islamic rituals why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards depression ? you can not just pick your two favorite trends , notice a correlation in them , and make a sweeping statement of generality . i mean , you can , and people have , but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis . at best it's a gross oversimplification of the push pull factors people experience . . basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control . we just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing . but one things for sure , depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not due solely to sex out of marriage . note that i never said that depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is due solely to extra marital sex . i specifically said that it was a prime cause of this , not the prime cause or the only cause of this i recognize that there are probably other factors too , but i think that extra marital sex and subsequent destabilization of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in psychological problems , including depression , in the west in the 20th century . fred rice

4			violation	batf	abuse	compound	murder	weapon	fire	waco			 batf fbi murders almost everyone in waco today ! 4 19  two of the nine who escaped the compound said the fire was deliberately set by cult members .  correction the fbi says that two of the nine who escaped said the fire was deliberately set by cult members . since the press was kept miles away , we have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government's claims in this matter . moreover , the batf has admitted having agents in the compound , and as far as i have been able to ascertain , those agents were still in the compound when the first shots were fired . for all we know , these two people may be the agents , who would certainly be unlikely to stay around and cook with the faithful . assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all . maybe i sound paranoid , but i watched janet reno last night harping on how much david koresh was a big , bad child abuser , and i kept wondering why she much less batf wanted us to infer that she had any jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place . i m positive that the sealed warrant is not for child abuse . what was it for ? peobably weapons violations . janet reno didn not say word one last night about weapons violations . why ? because she knows that such a case is no longer believable ?  if you believe that i speak for my company , or write today for my special investors packet .

3			symptom	compound			 is msg sensitivity superstition ? the funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to msg vary so greatly . some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face . some claim their heart skipped beats once in a while . both of these symptoms are related tachycardia . getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse . i suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood , since note sodium chloride monosodium glutamate . both are sodium compounds . our bodies require sodium , but like everything else , one can get too much of a good thing . some reacted with headache , again , this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate , from the sodium in the msg . distended crainial arteries , essentially . one of many causes of headaches . there is no discrepency her , necessarily . some stomach ache . well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related . again , not necessarily a discrepency . more likely a related reaction . vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten . if a person can not digest the stuff entirely possible the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long , and lacks an enzyme to break it down , gastrointestinal distress stomach or belly ache would be expected . some had watery eyes or running nose , these are respiratory reactions , and are now considered to be similar to vomitting . they are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds . they are adaptiove responses . of course , it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. but it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive , synergystic , subtractive , etc , etc. it would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish , and what else the person was exposed to . respiratory does sound suspicious but resopiration and heart rate are connected . things in the body are far from simple . very inetractive place , the vertebrate body .  some had itchy skin or rashes . people respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound . it depends upon what it is about the compound that pisses off their body . pollen , for example , of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people , because , when inhaled , it sets of the immune system , and an histamine attack is launched . the immune system goes overboard , causing the allergic person a lot of misery . and someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens chamomile , linden , etc . drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it . more serious accusations include respiration difficulty see above . and don not think that heart rate changes , and circulatory problems are not serious . they can be deadly . and brain damage . the area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin , the supra hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol , as well as somatostatin , and other steroids . testing for effective dose would be , uh , a wee bit unethical . now here is a new one vomiting . my guess is that msg becomes the number one suspect of any problem . in this case . it might be just food poisoning . absolutely . but it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say , undetected shrimp or mushrooms to which many are allergic , plus too much alcohol , and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home , plus , let's say , having contracted flu from one's sig . other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass . could be all sorts of things . but it might be the msg . if you heard things about msg , you may think it must be it . if noone else got sick , its likely not food poisoning . probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to . anyway , the human body's not a machine ; people vary widely in their responses , and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things . dianne murray

4			village	waco	country	soul	resolution	incident	gun			 waco survivors 1715 19 april the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story . this is simply rationalisation . it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent . that would require them to come up with a solution themselves . instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through . what's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all sorts of people desperately trying to get a revolution . it makes ambulance chasing by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime . for the last few months , benighted souls have been calling c span on issues as mundane as budget resolutions , saying that i don not know , i just have the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country , and so on . get real ! for a real case study in revolution , go to blockbuster video and check out underground , a film made about the weather underground in the 70's . even with all the strife back then , the revolution never did come . and waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times ? in the tape , it is interesting to see the way the weatherpersons dance around the issue of one of their defining moments , which was when a few of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in a greenwich village townhouse . the problem , one of them said , was that they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they forgot about their own personal safety and weren not careful . but of course that was society's fault , a society that didn not instill a sense of worth in the people , so they neglect their own safety . current apologists for koresh may pick up some important rationalization tips from this tape !  joe knapp

3			candida	notion	symptom	infection	yeast			 great post ! was candida bloom .  . of course , they are working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with associated mild inflammatory response can and does occur in a large number of people . if you reject this yeast hypothesis , then i would guess you would view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic endeavor . stay tuned . i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections . i can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms , while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms. to understand this skepticism , one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection . there have been quite a few , and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical . on the other hand , i am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility , spurred by suggestive clinical experience , to research it further . the doubters may be surprised . it has happened before . i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another . and , indeed , perhaps some of them do know i am the one who is currently ignorant . but i find this the most honest route , and so i am happy with it . russell

paul begins romans 14 with if someone is weak in the faith . do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith ? do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith ? you read jesus word in matt5 14 19 ? is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia missing the mark ? is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark ? however i would like to be clear that i do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day . as i indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited . whereas , the ten commandments and jesus words in matt5 14 19 are fairly clear , are they not ? are they clear or do you have doubts ? no , i don not believe that paul can overrule god . an important first step ; the realization that paul was human . however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience . yes , and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best , very weak in the faith ; most could not read , most were unfamiliar with the hebrew scriptures in even the septuagint form . paul adapted the message of the bible to a largely uneducated market . granted , this market still exists today , but do you count yourself as part of it ? to be weak in the faith is not missing the mark hamartia if you do the best that your education allows . are you doing the best ? the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews , but not on gentiles . there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws , but they are quite minimal . let me make clear that the law is none other than the pentateuch of genesis , exodus , leviticus , numbers , deuteronomy . what did jesus say about the law in matt5 14 19 ? where did jesus say that the law only applies to jews and that gentiles are above the law ? the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn not say that the law was abolished . it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn not apply to gentiles . who acknowledged this fact ? on what basis ? are we extra biblical at this point ? why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad gita is the only relevant text for gentiles , after all we see in the bible that it was magus from the east who observed the star signs of jesus ? why bother with any texts at all ? why not just follow whatever the church has to say ? thus there is no contradiction with mat 5 . i don not see how you can say this with a straight face . are you a follower of christ , or do you follow someone else ? are you saying that the words of jesus only apply to jews ? as far as i can tell , both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath . thus they continued to obey the law . how jewish was paul after he changed his name from saul ? the issue was and is with gentile christians , who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it . who says gentile christians are not covered by the first five books ? who says that gentile christians are above the ten commandments ? jesus dealt mostly with jews . i think we can reasonably assume that mat 5 was directed to a jewish audience . you are implying that jesus words are valid only for jews . is this really what you mean to say ? you do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the bible ? when you read jesus words , did you ever consider that maybe , just maybe jesus is talking to you , no matter what your race or sex ? if the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts of jesus are only directed to jews , why were they translated into english ? he did interact with gentiles a few times e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others . the terms used to describe the centurion see luke 7 suggest that he was a god fearer , i.e. a gentile who followed god , but had not adopted the whole jewish law . as paul would call him , one who was weak in the faith . he was commended by jewish elders as a worthy person , and jesus accepted him as such . this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law . which is more important 1 the recorded word of jesus or 2 indications that you can deduce from the bible ? was jesus god only of the jews , or god of all humankind of all race and sex ? however there's more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law . in order to get a full picture of the role of the law , we have to come to grips with paul's apparent rejection of the law , and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law . at least as i read paul , he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded . this is your understanding of paul . compare this to the word of jesus . are you christian or pauline ? again , this issue isn not one of the abolition of the law . in the middle of his discussion , paul notes that he might be understood this way , and assures us that that's not what he intends to say . rather , he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness . but ultimately it's an impossible standard , and one that has been superceded by christ again , this is your understanding of paul . did jesus say that the law was an impossible standard ? did jesus say that he superceded the law ? are you christian or pauline ? paul's comments are not the world's clearest here , and not everyone agrees with my reading . you acknowledge that it is your reading of paul . what did jesus say ? can you deny that matt5 14 19 is quite clear in its meaning ? are you christian or pauline ? but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law . it still remains as an uncompromising standard , from which not an iota or dot may be removed . for its purpose of convicting of sin , it's important that it not be relaxed . when did jesus say that the purpose of the law was conviction of sin ? however for christians , it's not the end ultimately we live in faith , not law . please reread matt5 14 19 . are you christian or pauline ? jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law , and stay away from the ceremonial details . are you saying that the ten commandments are ceremonial details ? paul's conclusion is similar . while he talks about the law being superceded , all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law , such as circumcision and the sabbath . he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards . you call observance of the sabbath , the day on which the lord rested , ceremonial ? has circumcision been superceded for christians ? . are you christian or pauline ? both . there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not , at least not in this case . jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles . that's why i have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion . as to general jewish views on this , i am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology , one by h . j . schoeps , and one whose author i can not come up with at the moment . both authors are jews . also , various christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups . mat 5 19 is clear that the law is still valid . it does not say that it applies to gentiles . and yes , i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is a ceremonial detail , when you are looking at the obligations of gentiles . similarly circumcision . i m not sure quite what else i can say on this subject . again , it's unfortunate the jesus didn not answer the question directly . however we do know 1 what the 1st cent . jewish approach was , 2 how jesus dealt with at least one gentile , and 3 how jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute i m referring to acts 15 more than paul . given that these are all in agreement , i don not see that there's a big problem . clh

ha ! optimists . the new proposal gets accepted ? almost nobody except some will be able to eavesdrop everybody else , but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed ! the proposal emphasizes on the former almost nobody which is clearly an improvement and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter guaranteed . yes , my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful . you think that it will not happen ? good luck . note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap . it's not just continued ability . it's guaranteed ability . before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for email and files , let's focus on this . yeah , that's exactly what your government wants you to think . let's take small steps , one at a time . concentrate on the current one , don not think about the future . trust us . one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony , or if the government intends to expand it . it's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention . they , unlike you , read what they write . though i share many of the concerns expressed by some , i find the proposal less threatening than many others , since right now most americans have no secure telephony , and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop . this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones . yes , it will . it will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now . it will allow only to the government to eavesdrop . if the scheme is secure , of course , which is yet to be proven . but how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow ? the new proposal guarantees him the ability to eavesdrop then . hell , that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed is that mentally pervert . without access to the keys . great . the greatest cryptographer of all times david sternlight tm has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is highly secure . i guess , that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the two major crypto evaluating companies , right ? gee , now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method for david sternlight has already done all the job for them . this would meet the needs of u.s. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries , including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies . it allows the nsa to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs . trust us , we are from the government and we are here to help you . most legitimate u.s. corporations trust the nsa , and would be delighted to have a high security system certified by them , even at the price of depositing keys in escrow . i see no difficulty in creating a reliable those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety , do not deserve either . this or something like that ; i don not have the exact quote , but the meaning is the same has been said by one of your great men . maybe you should study their works more carefully , if you have the brains to understand them , of course . from my point of view this is a fair starting point . there are concerns that need to be addressed , including the reliability of the escrows . but in the main question is to guarantee to availability of really secure cryptography to the masses . gee , if the proposal was saying we guarantee that every american will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s he would like and regard this proposal as just a default , voluntary implementation , there would have been much less opposition . for some reason , they didn not even try to promise you that . i wonder why . was orwell off only by 10 years ? return we get access to high security crypto . no , in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled . many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed . while the above is just rumors , and while even if it is true , it is not done easily , the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys . it might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick . or who has only one of them . nsa also told you that des is secure , why don not you simply trust them , huh ? there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable . it doesn not have to it is guaranteed to be easily breakable just get the keys . it might be even easier , but until there is some evidence , this is just a wild speculation . be , nor does it have to have trapdoors , if the government can get the keys the trapdoors are there . in government's hands . the keys . pursuant to a legitimate court order . thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries , while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order . legitimate ?

5			atheism	february	cheer	matthew			 where are they now ?  wow . leave your terminal for a few months and everyone you remember goes away how depressing . actually , there are a few familiar faces out there , counting bob and kent , but i don not seem to recognize anyone else . has anyone heard from graham matthews recently , or has he gotten his degree and sailed for greener pastures tm ?  which brings me to the point of my posting . how many people out there have been around alt . atheism since 1990 ? i have done my damnedest to stay on top of the newsgroup , but when you fall behind , you really fall behind it's still not as bad as rec . arts . startrek used to be , but i digress . has anyone tried to keep up with the deluge ? inquiring minds want to know ! also does anyone keep track of where the more infamous posters to alt . atheism end up , once they leave the newsgroup ? just curious , i guess .  cheers , tom bruno i am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded respect for people who have been on newsgroups mailing lists longer than i have , so you certainly have my sympathy tom . i have only been semi regularly posting it is toughto keep up since this february , but i have been reading and following the threads since last august my school's newsreader was down for months and our incompetent computing services never bothered to find a new feed site , so it wasn not accepting outgoing postings . i don not think anyone keeps track of where other posters go it's that old love em and leave em internet for you again . best regards ,  adam john cooper verily , often have i laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because they had no claws .
1			advance	scheme	session	screen	windows			 any video gurus feel like attacking this quirk . hi there , i m having a bizarre video problem within windows 3 . 1 . i have a 286 with a gvga 16 video board i have been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers . i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes it's screen . the problem is that once windows has been envoked , the colors start changing themselves . at first i thought it was hardware , but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session , you don not have any problems until you get back to windows however , when you initially return to windows , the original colors get refreshed properly . also , it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire , the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme , but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey , then blue , etc. the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple ish black . if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows the screen gets refreshed again . if i don not log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network , everything is fine . i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring , then from the net to this machine . when i ran into problems , i deleted everything on this machine and the net , and tried bouncing it again . when that didn not work , i tried reloading windows to no avail . any thoughts on things to check out ? i am totally baffled ! thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction ! linda cornell uw office of research

3			space	flight	shuttle	tank	orbit	launch			 space station redesign , jsc alternative 4   . text of options a and b deleted .  option c single core launch station . this is the jsc lead option . basically , you take a 23 ft diameter cylinder that's 92 ft long , slap 3 space shuttle main engines on the backside , put a nose cone on the top , attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket motors , and launch the can . some key features are complete end to end ground integration and checkout 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels body mounted radiators which adds protection against micrometeroid & orbital debris 2 centerline docking ports one on each end 7 berthing ports a single pressurized volume , approximately 26 , 000 cubic feet twice the volume of skylab . 7 floors , center passageway between floors 10 kw of housekeeping power  somehow i have a strange attraction for this idea living in a modular home maybe has altered my mind . the only thing that scares me is the part about simply strapping 3 ssme's and a nosecone on it and just launching it . i have this vision of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the complete loss of the new modular space station not just a peice of it as would be the case with staged in orbit construction .  i certainly like this option c . it's much more like the original phase b studies from the early 1970's . good stuff ! this is actually more like the stuff from phase a and mol . phase b ended with a power tower approach . it's also very expensive in terms of upfront development costs . so all you get is a redistribution of costs from the shuttle flights to the contractors who build it .

in addition , br the four gospel accounts are very much in harmony . it is also well known that the comments in josephus relating to jesus were inserted badly by later editors . as for the four gospels being in harmony on the issue of jesus . you know not of what you speak . here are a few contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension . the death of judas after the betrayal of jesus acts 1 18 now this man judas purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out . matt . 27 5 7 and he judas cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself . and the chief priests . bought with them the potter's field . what was jesus prediction regarding peter's denial ? before the cock crow matthew 26 34 before the cock crow twice mark 14 30 how many times did the cock crow ? mar 14 72 and the second time the cock crew . and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept . mat 26 74 then began he to curse and to swear , saying , i know not the man . and immediately the cock crew . mat 26 75 and peter remembered the word of jesus , which said unto him , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly . luk 22 60 and peter said , man , i know not what thou sayest and immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew . luk 22 61 and the lord turned , and looked upon peter . and peter remembered the word of the lord , how he had said unto him , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . joh 13 38 jesus answered him , wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? verily , verily , i say unto thee , the cock shall not crow , still thou hast denied me thrice . joh 18 27 peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew . destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made ! not the only time he does this either . mat 27 9 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet , saying , and they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of israel did value ; zechariah 11 11 13 nothing in jeremiah remotely like what was the color of the robe placed on jesus during his trial ? scarlet matthew 27 28 purple john 19 2 the time of the crucifiction mark says the third hour , or 9 am , but john says the sixth hour noon was when the sentence was passed . inscription on the cross matthew this is jesus the king of the jews mark the king of the jews luke this is the king of the jews john jesus of nazareth the king of the jews what did they give him to drink ? vinegar matthew 27 34 wine with myrrh mark 15 23 women at the cross matthew said many stood far off , including mary magdaline , mary the mother of james , and the mother of zebedee's children . mark and luke speak of many far off , and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less . john says that jesus's mother stood at the cross , along with her sister and mary magdalene . jesus last words matt . 27 46 , 50 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , eli , eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ? jesus , when he cried again with a loud voice , yielded u the ghost luke23 46 and when jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , father , unto thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus , he gave up the ghost john19 30 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , it is finished and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost events of the crucifiction matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent , that there was an earthquake , and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour , that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem , appearing to many beating jesus to the resurection . mark and luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints . john is the only one who mentions jesus's side being peirced . burial of jesus matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples , and for the tomb to be sealed . all of this was supposedly done , but the other gospels do not mention these precautions . how long was jesus in the tomb ? depends where you look ; matthew 12 40 gives jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth , and mark 10 34 has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again . as far as i can see from a quick look , the prophecies have after three days , but the post resurrection narratives have on the third day . time of the resurection matthew says sunday at dawn , mark says the sun was rising , and john says it was dark . who was at the empty tomb ? is it mat 28 1 in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre . mar 16 1 and when the sabbath was past , mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james , and salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him . joh 20 1 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre . whom did they see at the tomb ? mat 28 2 and , behold , there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it . mat 28 3 his countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow mat 28 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men . mat 28 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus , which was crucified . mar 16 5 and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted . luk 24 4 and it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments joh 20 12 and seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of jesus had lain . belief that the disciples stole jesus's body matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story , but no other gospel makes this claim . appearences of the risen jesus matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told them , to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee . the disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon , and met jesus there . this was his only appearance , except to the women at the tomb . matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples . mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country , and that they told the rest of the disciples , who refused to believe . later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime . luke says two followers went , the same day that jesus rose from the dead , to emmaus , a village eight miles from jeruselem , and there jesus jioned them but was unrecognised . while they ate a meal together that evening , they finally recognised jesus , whereopon he dissapeared . returning at once to jeruselem , they told the disciples of their experience , and suddenly jesus appeared among them , frightening them , as they thought he was a spirit . jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them . john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose , in jeruselem , where they were hiding . he breathed the holy ghost opon them , but thomas was not present and refused to believe . eight days later jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas . once more jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not recognised . after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat , jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them . they all eat together and converse . the book of acts further adds to the confusion . it says that jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection thus contradicting matthew , mark , luke and john and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight . and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up , two men stood by them in white apparel which also said , ye men of galilee , why stand ye gazing into heaven ? this same jesus , which is taken from you into heaven , shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts 1 3 11 paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension , although he does not say where . he also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw jesus . 1 cor 15 6 8 . the ascension matthew says nothing about it . mark casually says that jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in jeruselem . luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that while he blessed them , he was parted from them and carried up into heaven . john says nothing about it . acts contradicts all of the above . see previous section when second coming ? mat 24 34 verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled . mar 13 30 verily i say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done . luk 21 32 verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled . 1 thessalonians 4 15 18 how many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention 1 corinthians 15 5 12 matthew 27 3 5 minus one from 12 acts 1 9 26 mathias not elected until after resurrection mat 28 16 then the eleven disciples went away into galilee , into a mountain where jesus had appointed them . ascend to heaven and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven . 2 kings 2 11 no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven , the son of man . john 3 13 as you can see , there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial , crucifiction and resurection of jesus . if these are good witnesses , you would think that they could get some of these important details right ! in fact , i cannot find very many points on where they agree . you would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing ! because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error , the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth . due to the nature of the story , i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of truth . alan

2			run	roger	utility	country	team	player	baseball	minority			 bonilla originator news nimaster in roger if black players can not survive being mediocre or worse , how can mcrae and chamberlain be explained ? nobody's saying it's a hard and fast rule . my point is that white players are likely to stick around longer if they are mediocre . i went through tb iii and made a list of 10 year of and 1b who were negative in both adjusted batting runs and total player rating . tpr has some problems , but it's generally not too far off for a career , imho . all players who played most of their career after 1960 were considered . here are a through i haven not done the rest yet armas , bailor , balboni , bannister , beauchamp , beniquez , bergman , berry , biittner , blair , bochte , bonnell , bosley , bradford , l . brown , buckner , davalillo , dernier , dilone , gaston , geiger , geronimo , gosger , heep , iorg . a few black players there ; a lot of white and hispanic . hmmm . one question . how do you differentiate hispanic and black ? after all , some people fall into both categories . rafael ramiriez comes to mind . and he would fit into this grouping also . oops . he's not an of 1b . although he is a light hitting utility player . sorry about that . but miguel dilone would qualify , if i remember correctly . when i say black , i mean us born black people for the purposes of this discussion . hispanic players were in baseball before 1947 , and one team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better with the local audience than blacks did . and why would more hispanics stick around than blacks ? don not know . but remember this is the country that had special racial laws for one group and one group only blacks . our national history includes huge , long term , global tensions regarding the black minority ; the hispanic minority , while often discriminated against , has never been the object of national obsession . it might also be worth your while to subdivide the data into careers starting at 10 year intervals . i would think that your prediction would be most true for careers starting in the 1960's and least true for careers starting in the 1980's . of course , you would also have to compare total ml racial percentages for the era in question . absolutely . as i said before , i expect that this effect is disappearing . but it certainly did exist , and all out talk of twg's and all that is not without some small reason . i m of the opinion that your point is less valid today than it was 25 years ago , but i would be curious to see the data . well , there's the list go for it ! i will cull some more names as i go . i expect you are right , btw . roger

3			infection			 how often do kids fall sick ? etc. our 20 month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care . he was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once . now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month . most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well , with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4 . i know kids in day care fall sick more often , but we are beginning to wonder how often more often really is , whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average , what the longer term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are , and what we can do to build up his resistance . he really enjoys his day care and we think it's great too , but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny . are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions ? how often do kids in their first , second and third years fall sick ? how often do they get colds , flus , ear infections ? is there any data on home care vs . day care ? does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later , does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later , or does it not have any long term effect ? does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects ? how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal , and what does one do about it ? is there any way to build immunity and resistance ? any data , information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated . thanks a lot . ashwin .
4			country	russia	being	constitution	space	gift	russian	angel	education	republic	gun	enemy	war	roger	aid	hundred	weapon	defense			 top ten reasons not to aid russians don not look at me . i want to send aid to russia . many other conservatives do as well .  yes , it was nixon who was most vocal about giving money to russia . it makes me proud to be a libertarian . it appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win , then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around . enemy ? sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative always been commies , always will be . ok , i should have said former enemy . i was being sarcastic about what interventionists want to do . i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti west slogans coming from his opponents in the russian congress . i sure know who i want to back . could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun ? have you considered a non interventionist policy ? if market reform does happen , russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy . they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason . if they don not reform , then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them . then their's the ideological point . we want to win russia over to our type of government a type where the rulers can rule without limit over everyone's finances ? it's like subsidizing the wealthy countries japan , germany , etc. with free defense , and then trade warring with them because of the economic competition . it's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke . better to let them degenerate into civil war ? remember all those nuclear weapons in russia . i cannot imagine that they would not be used in a civil war . if nationialists take over and , even if they prevent a civil war , most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries like ukraine . i also cannot imagine ukraine giving up land without a fight , possibly nuclear . how does this affect us ? well , we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of europe are blown away i think we would feel something . a massive breakup of a country that spans 1 6th the planet is bound to have affects here . of course , there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies or struggling democracies . if a $ 1 . 6 billion gift was that important to our well being , couldn not it be raised voluntarilly ? people already give over $ 100 billion a year to charity .  i ask myself , what law could we pass to prevent government from doing stupid , frivilous things with our money ? then i think , the constitution was supposed to do that . could someone please tell me what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries ? seriously . seriously . everyone has different opinions on what is stupid . my two causes are aid to russia and a strong space program . someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish . that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy . instead of gridlock on a massive scale , we only have gridlock on a congressional scale . it seems instead of gridlock on any scale , we have aid to russia , expensive space programs , national charity that doesn not help the poor , and probably , studies of drunken goldfish . i think limited government is more key than how democratic it is . btw , who is to decide 'stupid ? this is just like those who want to impose their morals on others just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against that was an opinion , and libertarians are very big on free speech . actually , my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party . it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim . if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be very libertarian . consider it a compromise . how much money would your fellow russia aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose weren not using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you don not support ? we could do that 100 years ago but not now . people have been saying that for hundreds of years . like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making . all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information , than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues . julie disclaimer all opinions here belong to my cat and no one else roger collins sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself . can he , then , be trusted with the government of others ?

5			country	war	agency	arm	theist	atheist			 gulf war was re death penalty was re political atheists ? i looked back at this , and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which i had claimed and you pooh poohed . the us has not sold iraq any arms.  what about the land mines which have already been mentioned ? i asked around in one of the areas you suggested yourself , and presented the information i got . no mention of us landmines was given . other countries like kuwait . information is hard to prove . you are claiming that the us sold information ? prove it . information is hard to prove , almost certainly if the us did sell information , then that fact is classified , and you can not prove it .  oh , very neat . dismiss everything i say unless i can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt something which you yourself admit i can never prove to your satisfaction . thanks , i will stick to squaring circles .  mathew okay , so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable evidence ? i didn not realize you were a theist i am doubting a claim presented without any evidence to support it . if you are able to present real evidence for it , then great . but unsupported claims , or even claims by such and such news agency will not be accepted . if you want to stick to the sheer impossible , instead of the merely difficult , then fine . the statement that if such a fact is classified , then you can not prove it , is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law . if you have access to classified information that you know to be classified , and you reveal it , there is a good chance that you or someone else the person who revealed it to you , is going to jail . i never said that you couldn not prove it to my satisfaction , i merely said that it was difficult . who said i try and make things easy for people i am arguing with unless of course , they need the handicap .   never program and drink beer at the same m 2 time . it doesn not work .

4			country	logic	amendment	constitution	right	statistic	gun	war	firearm	defense	vote			 the pill for deer no hunting  the second amendment is about sovereignty , not sporting goods .  perfectly correct , but it won not make any difference . hmm . i beg to differ . it will probably make a big difference at some point .  self defense is a valid reason for rkba .  the vast majority get through life without ever having to own , use or display a firearm . besides , there are other means of self protection which can be just as effective as firearms. thankfully , it is true that the majority go through life without having to use a firearm . howver , there are situations where firearms are the most effective means of self protection . what other means do you propose as equally effective ?  freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion , necessity , or scientific scrutiny .  new to this planet ? everything is dependent on either public or political opinion , usually political . to imagine that inalienable rights are somehow wired into the vast cold cosmos is purest egotism and a dangerous delusion . new to this country ? new to political theory ? alas , i was speaking of principle . without principle , all attempts at republican forms of gov not are futile . there are times when public and political opinion are contrary to principle , which is why we have a constitution which enumerates gov not powers and presumes certain rights . a major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the majority .  no arguments against rkba can withstand scientific scrutiny .  they don not have to . like so many other things , the issue is one of perception rather than boring statistics . every time some young innocent is gunned down in a drive by , every time some kid is murdered for a jacket , every time a store clerk is executed for three dollars in change , every time some moron kills his wife because she took the last beer from the fridge , every time someone hears a bang in the night . the rkba dies . the stats are not all that clearly behind firearms the protection factor does not strongly outweigh the mindless mayhem factor . given society as we now experience it it seems safer to get rid of as many guns as possible . that may be an error , but enough active voters believe in that course . this is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought , not immediate perception . of course , it doesn not always work that way . fortunately , while there are no guarantees , logic sometimes does prevail . and , if not , there are still means for correction . as far as enough active voters are concerned , that is still an open question until the vote is made .  how do you intend to 'silence rkba supporters ?  talk all you want . talk about the good old days when you used to own firearms. after a while , such talk will take on the character of war stories . and no one will be very interested anymore . you portray a possible scenario for the future . but , how will you silence rkba supporters right now ? as long as public debate is allowed , such debate will continue . if we allow public debate to be restricted or denied , then we will get a gov not we deserve . al standard disclaimer

4			violence	crime			 race and violence joe , as usual , this issue of dysfunction , of bad values , of messed up culture is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining problems in our community . from your post , you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with african americans , value wise , culture wise or something , very appealing . i never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us . the socio economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels , like poverty , which exists among us in large proportion , i mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems , we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors , and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have . but nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction . no , that has socioeconomic factors to it , but for africa americans , its gotta be a dysfunction . basically , i think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don not want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans , and that this is about 80 of the problem . it could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us , that this has a very effective negative effect on us . no , something is wrong with us . non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say , because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us , instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage . i would get angry if it werent so damn typical . peace aaron

2			espn	pitch	pitcher	game	television	catcher	baseball			 game length was re braves update ! i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that gant should have listened to him . however , what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games . you are the first person non mediot i have seen endorse this policy . i wholeheartedly endorse it . i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd and other announcers bitching about it . i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a ticket , i don not mind a game that last more than 2 10 . i really don not understand it . haven not been to many a's games , have you ? seriously , i don not mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played . however , i don not like 3 2 games that take 3 hours , because there's a lot of dead time going on in that game . i don not find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches , or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound , or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason whitey herzog used to be the master of this ; the game could be way out of reach , and he would still be making switches for platoon advantage . i want to see the game , not people standing around . i don not really enjoy watching nfl football games in person , for example , because there's so much dead time you don not really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television , because they are busy showing you replays . i don not like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game the ncaa has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year they are going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year , and they are going to a 35 second clock . there's also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if i m watching them on the tube , and if i m going there in person . for me , going to an a's game has become a major commitment of time , one that i m not willing to make that often the length of their games is costing the a's revenue from me . sherri nichols
2			talent	state	god	cub	season	fan	player	brave	love	pitching	team	play			 and america's team is . but why ?  well , officially it's the braves . at least up until they started winning it was . are they still , officially ? if so , why ? and how did they receive this label ?  unoffically , but without a doubt , america's team is the cubs . why ? well , my guess is because america loves underdogs . every year , no matter the cubs talent or the predictions , they never as close to never as possible win anything . over the years , as the losing has mounted , america has fallen in love with these perennial losers . the cubs have more fans in chicago then some teams do worldwide . the cubs have more fans worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined . an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season like no one else . including the ws champs it must be that eternal hope . this is the year . they have got the talent . they are off to a good start . they have got the pitching or hitting , or whatever their strong point is at the time . it's that inevitability that the cubs will eventually win the ws again . when ? only god knows . since it's been so long , it could come at any time , or it could be another 85 years . but until they do finally win , and start winning consistently , the cubs will remain america's lovable underdogs . the cubs are . america's team . orin . bradley u     i m really a jester in disguise ! you are absolutely correct . braves fans are nothing but a bunch of bandwagoners . correct me if i am wrong , but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give away a ticket to see the braves play . i would bet my next paycheck that 80 of the so called braves fans living outside of georgia at the present time can not name more than 3 players from their 1988 season . on the other hand , ask any cubs fan living anywhere in the united states to name 3 players from any given year and 80 of them probably could . granted , the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park , but that does not mean they diserve the title america's team the only reason they are considered america's team is because of ted turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation . i will consider toronto america's team before the braves go reds !  chris babbitt  all i want in life is a woman to love , and a woman to care for my kids . hopefully the two will never meet .

1			wire	fan	procedure	chip	mileage	mac	quadra			 quadra clock modification long quadra 700 clock acceleration instructions quadra , clock , acceleration , oscillator here is how i modified my quadra 700 for higher speed . previously i had been using a variable speed overdrive for accelerating my cpu but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds . your mileage may vary . the top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand . my personal q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far . i didn not have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds . parts clock oscillators 4 pin ttl variety you will need a selection of speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up . the cpu will run at 1 2 the oscillator speed . the original one is a 50 mhz unit . i recommend getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one . i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey 1 800 344 4539 for less than $ 5 . 00 each . some of their part numbers are 50 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x121 62 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x136 66 mhz ttl clock oscillator part ctx137 don not get the half size clock oscillators . they won not fit . there are also cmos clock oscillators . i haven not tried one in a quadra . they work fine in iisi's  socket obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as a 14 pin dip package . alternatively , use 4 machined socket pins from an augat style socket . just cut them out of the socket . cooling fan a very small 12 volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a must my vso came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto it . it had a pass through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable . you should rig up something similar or risk frying your cpu .  procedure 1 insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here . 2 remove the top lid of the machine . you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower . follow the usual anti static precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do this . unplug all cables , wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac .  3 remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up . the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply . you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply . leave that alone . the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release .  4 look at the rear of the tower assembly . you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive , a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive . disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it .  5 unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount 6 look down the posterior , cylindrical section of the plastic tower . a phillips head screw is at the base . remove it , taking care not to drop it into the case . a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here . 7 remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower . this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly . slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case . 8 remove the interrupt switch assembly . it is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left , front edge of the motherboard pull the middle , rear plastic prong up and forward the entire device will release .  9 unplug the speaker cable . squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case .  10 remove the motherboard form the case . lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm . this allows it to clear the clear plastic power light guide . slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm . the motherboard then comes directly out .  11 locate the 50 mhz clock crystal . it is a small metal box near the cpu chip . note and remember its orientation . the new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation .  very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator . some of the pins may be bent over . simply desolder then unbend them . be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board  i used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task . this is not appropriate for a first soldering experience . the motherboard is a multi layer design with very fine traces easily damaged without proper care .  12 install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was . 13 put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket . you could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins . this may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later . i suggest using a new 50 mhz clock .  14 install your cooling fan system to complete the modification .  14 reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place . 15 snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly . plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard  16 reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 1 cm posterior of its intended position . lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case . once fully down , slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place .  17 reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables . dont not forget the floppy drive cable . 18 replace the phillips head screw 19 drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in . 20 plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount . 21 reattach your cables and power cords . cross your fingers and turn on the mac . it should make the usual power on chord if it doesn not , something is amiss . immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork . if all is not well , you have my sincere condolences .  hopefully , all will work normally . turn the machine back off and replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one . reboot and be astounded .  you will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable . with my vso , a machine lock up might take 8 hours of operation to occur . in the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator 36 hours i have not had a single problem .  good luck to

3			advance	symptom			 friend needs advice . a friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information . a few weeks ago , she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out . she would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out . by the way , she is 29 or 30 years old . it continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar . since that time , she has gotten two more bald spots of the same size . other symptoms she's described include several months of an irregular menstrual cycle which is strange for her , because she has always been extremely regular ; laryngitis every few days she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice , and then the next day it's fine ; dizzy spells she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning , including one that knocked her to the ground ; and general fatigue . she went to a dermatologist first who couldn not find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems. he did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal . she's very concerned and very confused . does anyone have any ideas or suggestions ? i told her that i thought she should see an endocrinologist does that sound like the right idea ? by the way , in case you are going to ask . no , she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms . no , she hasn not recently changed her hair products and she hasn not gotten a perm , coloring , or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out . thanks in advance for any help !
5			mary	god	jesus			 it's all mary's fault ! you know , it just occurred to me today that this whole christian thing can be blamed solely on mary .  so , she's married to joseph . she gets knocked up . what do you think ol joe will do if he finds she's been getting around ? so mary comes up with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant .  nice attempt chris . verrry close . you missed the conspiracy by 1 step . joseph knew who knocked her up . he couldn not let it be known that somebody else got ol mary prego . that wouldn not do well for his popularity in the local circles . so what happened is that she was feeling guilty , he was feeling embarrassed , and they decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both . clever indeed . come to think of it . i have gained a new respect for the couple . maybe joseph and mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus . dave buckminster fuller how is that one o keeper of the nicknames ?
2			clutch	honda			 honda clutch chatter anyone else experiencing a similar problem ? this concerns the clutch on a 92 honda accord 5 speed . when the clutch is first used in the morning , about the first 4 miles of shifting , there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up . then the clutch shifts smoothly . this chatter started when i moved to the san francisco bay area from a low humidity environment . the dealer stated that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to non asbestos clutch material . no remedy ! seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates . any comments out there ?

2			play	nhl	roger	coach	talent	ranger	league	season	game	player			 this year's biggest and worst opinion . nhl , awards messier is a joke this year bad back not withstanding . his play is the reason the rangers will be on the golf course in a couple of weeks . gartner is my choice the guy works his butt off every game .  kovalev no surprise . he's played adequately but as bad defensively kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielson . roger needs players who can not think for themselves and can only skate in straight bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and not know how to turn them into bure and selanne . as was predicted in preseason . perhaps he will pull an alex mogilny in a couple of years and surprise us then . zubov wasn not expected to make it out of the minors this season and owing to the number of injuries , has proved to be a very pleasant surprise .  get muckler as coach , and kovalev will look like mogilny . the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got players like messier , kovalev , and graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking , while hiring coaches who are interested in rope a dope strategies . if you want the roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you don not go out and get a mark messier , who is an old dog who can not learn new tricks from a known loser , and you don not waste your draft picks on players like kovalev . gerald gerald

1			font	default	setting			 xmtextfield truncation with lang bug ? i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif , but i m hoping is really just a mistake on my part . does anyone know anything about this problem .  i am using an xmtextfield , and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring . the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed , the text is getting truncated , depending on the setting of the environment variables lang more specifically lc all . when they are set to japanese , the text gets truncated . when they are set to english , everything works fine . i am taking the default for xmncolumns . please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual application , just in my sample code to make things easier  i am running motif 1 . 2 , x11r5 via hpux9 . 01 . my test program is set up to handle 16 bit kanji characters . i have remembered to do xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts .  don not know if this matters , but my dialog box and textfield is initially created with uil .   the problem does not happen with xmtext . unfortunately substituting xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta !  i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it . my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese , but since i don not have the source to look at it is just a guess . the problem was that textfield was improperly walking the string ; it used the character count instead of the byte count . a significan oops . the problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic patch from hp support services . tom mcfarland

4			camp	war	village	violence	army			 israeli expansion lust it depends entirely on how you define war . the actual fighting largely predates the arab invasions after all deir yassin happened in midapril well before the arab invasion . how do you define war ? do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war , or is that only when the jews do them ? i would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until i express an opinion before deciding i should be flamed for it . as for war i am not sure how i would define it . if you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started . would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's ? violence but not war . i personally think that war , as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever , requires organisation , planning and some measure of regualr or semi regular forces . perhaps the arab liberation army counts . i could easily be convinced it was so . from what i know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation . the haganah and palmach certainly did . that is not a cause for criticism , it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the zionist camp . of course , this isn not war , since it's only the arabs attacking . now you are being silly aren not you ? in any case the war did not start with the invasion of the arab armies . you see we both agree on something . and the previous posters were wrong , no ? just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets against northern israel . where does uprising end and war begin ? again i am not sure , i doubt you want my opinion anyway , but i think war requires organisation as i said before . it needs a group to command and plan . if fatah lauches rockets from southern lebanon and are you sure you have the right group not the moslems again ? then that sounds like war to me . stone throwing does not . joseph askew  joseph askew , gauche and proud in the autumn stillness , see the pleiades , remote in thorny deserts , fell the grief . disclaimer ? sue , see if i care north of our tents , the sky must end somwhere , actually , i rather like brenda beyond the pale , the river murmurs on .

4			state	country			 clinton's immunization program on the news last night clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling his so called stimulus package . it seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free immunizations for poor kids .  immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to go have it done . the problem is not the cost , it is the irresponible parents who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done .  i don not know where you live , but this is not the case nationawide . perhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to do so , but in my area and most areas where i know people , immunizations cost $ $ $ . nationwide , the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50 , but it is reportedly as low as 10 in some inner city neighborhoods . i bet more than 10 kids living in such neighborhoods are already covered by medicaid . here in massachussets , we have had a universal immunization program , the kind of clinton seems to be proposing , for many years two decades ? mass immunization rate is 65 . what about the other 35 ? i guess some parents are indeed too ignorant or too lazy , or simply do not care .  sorry to shatter your stereotypes . ?   in case you haven not noticed , clintonites are pushing a universal health care access program . access here means that folks who do not give a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services delivered to their doorsteps .     disclaimer opinions expressed are mine , not my employer's .    disclaimer opinions expressed are mine , not my employer's .

2			fan	roger	baseball	morris	game	player			 dave kingman for the hall of fame originator news nimaster hi , baseball fans ! so what do you say ? don not you think he deserves it ? i mean , heck , if dave winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it , as is lee smith ha , then why don not we give dave kingman a chance ? or darrell evans ! yeah , yeah ! after the hall of fame takes in them , it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon . um , what ? eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time . winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years , and excellently on several occasions . dave kingman's best year was like darryl strawberry's typical year with the mets . darrell evans , too , did a whole lot more than just hit homers , which is all that kong did . well , in any case , i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today's standards , marginal . whom are you talking about ? yes , eddie murray is marginal , but that's because he's 38 years old . he wasn not marginal for a long time . honestly , ozzie smith and robin yount don not belong there . they are both shortstops that just hung around for a long time . big deal . not . smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better than anyone else ever has . yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago , in case you hadn not noticed . one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder . let's be a little more selective , huh ? stop handing out these honors so liberally . save them for the guys who really deserve it . face it , if like whom ? there are many players in the hall who aren not anywhere near as goos as the guys you are running down . something isn not done , there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore . when that's already the case , by some standards . but the bad players in the hall are all from the 20's and 30's . recent picks have generally been excellent . certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates , the absurdity is apparent . gee , can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan ? no , but who cares ? was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth ? not really . but he obviously belongs there . the hall has generally had about the top 1 of major leaguers . as more players come through the game , more will be in that top 1 . and , yes , it's pretty easy to argue that smith , yount , evans , winfield , etc. are in the top 1 . dave kingman on the other hand , was a liability throughout most of his career . of course , garvey hasn not gotten a lot of hof press , so i don not know what you mean . as for ryan , is his w l better than morris ? that's what a lot of voters tend to look at . and morris was awfully good for a decade , and doesn not lead mlb history in walks allowed , either . roger

temporary camps set up in its territory . demirok disclosed that pkk has three safe houses in south cyprus , used by terrorists such as ferhat . in the camps , he added , terrorists were trained to use various weapons including rpg's and anti aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from the greek government . greek cypriot government has gone to the extent of issuing special identification cards to pkk members so that they can travel from one region to another without being confronted by legal obstacles . demirok's account was confirmed by another pkk defector , fatih tan

service , mossad , is reported to have acquired significant information in connection with the camps set up in the troodos mountains in cyprus for the training of militants of the pkk and asala armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia . according to sources close to mossad , about 700 kurdish , greek cypriot and armenian militants are undergoing training in the troodos mountains in southern cyprus . the same sources stated that abu nidal's special advisers are giving military training to the pkk and asala militants in the camps . they added that the militants leave southern cyprus for libya , lebanon , syria , greece and iran after completing their training . mossad has established that due to the clashes which were taking place among the terrorist groups based in syria , the pkk and asala organisations moved to the greek cypriot part of cyprus , where they would be more comfortable . they also transferred a number of their camps in northern syria to the troodos mountains . mossad revealed that the armenian national movement , which is known as the mna , has opened liaison offices in nicosia , athens and tripoli in order to meet the needs of the camps . the offices are used to provide material support for the armenian camps . meanwhile , the leader of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , george habash , is reported to have ordered his men not to participate in the operations carried out by the pkk & asala , which he described as extreme racist , extreme nationalist and fascist reliable sources have said that habash believed that the recent operations carried out by the pkk militants show that organisation to be a band of irregulars engaged in extreme nationalist operations . they added that he instructed his militants to sever their links with the pkk and avoid clashing with it . it has been established that george habash expelled asala militants from his camp after asala's connections with drug trafficking were exposed .

sex outside of marriage , abuse of sex is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage ? isn not it an unatural use of what god has given us ? why is it that homosexuals are using the grace of god as a license to practice sin ? for certain persons have crept in unnoticed , those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation , ungodly persons who turn the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord , jesus christ jude 4 nasb what is defined by god as a legitimate marriage ? for this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the shall become one flesh . gen 2 24 nasb and he answer and said , have you not read , that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female , and said , for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ? consequently they are no longer two , but one flesh . what therefore god has joined together , let no man separate . matt 19 4 6 nasb but because of immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband . let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife , and likewise also the wife to her husband . 1 corinthians 7 4 , 5 nasb there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus , most of which christians ignore completely . they never even bother to examine them . they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual . well , i have news for you . any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs . unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too , but buried pretty deep . and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us . i disagree . every law that is written in leviticus should be looked at as sin . that is why we have a need for a savior . i can understand someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the levitcal law , but i would hope that they would repent when confronted with it . i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse . well , la ti da . so what ? this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape . i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality . it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed , consensual human adult realtionships , so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut . if you cannot address the actual issues , you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world . if you want to address bestiality , that is your business , not mine . and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings . you want to dismiss us , and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so . also i noticed that the preceeding verses say . also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity . and you shall not have intercourse with your neighbors wife , to be defiled with her . leviticus 18 19 , 20 nasb these verses are just as relevant as you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female ; it is an abomination . leviticus 18 22 nasb why was god telling the israelites not to practice such things ? do not defile yourselves by any of these things ; for by all these the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled . for the land has become defiled , therefore i have visited its punishment upon it , so the land has spewed out its inhabitants . but as for you , you are to keep my statutes and judgments , and shall not do any of these abominations , neither the native , nor the alien who sojourns among you leviticus 18 24 26 nasb he is the lord . listen to what he has to say . nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals . we do love you , but we don not agree that what you practice is not sin . you have not truly repented of your sin . we hate the sin that is within your lives . i hate sin that is in my life . all christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives . confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance . yes i agree with john 3 17 , but i also know that jesus said , repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt 3 17 . if you don not agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it ? this means that you remain in bondage to it . repent from it and god will set you free . in his love , mike  michael christensen trust the lord with all your heart , senior product support engineer and do not lean on your own procom technology , incorporation understanding . proverbs 3 5 nasb

3			client	liberty			 another key registration body bites the dust imho one of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the aclu . i think this is poor choice . the aclu is essentially a group of auditors they audit how people's civil liberties are administered . traditionally , auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things , and with good reason . when i was a systems programmer , it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view , but wouldn not tell us how to fix it . i always figured they just liked to critcize , without doing the work to help fix the problem . then i took a stint as an auditor , and i found out the real reason . auditors don not like to recommend solutions , because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later . the auditee can say , well , you told us this way would be ok . it compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job . taking the case at hand , suppose aclu becomes a key half registrar . suppose that , perhaps through some error on aclu's part , a key half gets away that shouldn not , and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties . the aclu gets wind of this , and wants to take it to court . but they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff , which is not an easy position to be in . there are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors at one place where i worked , when payroll checks were printed , they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine . this drum was kept by the auditors who also kept the check stock , and was brought down to data processing when it was time to do the checks . i believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks if they were done yesterday , and someone wants to do them again today , he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed . determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process , one much more prone to mistakes that could put the aclu in a protecting the client versus protecting the aclu conflict of interest as always , my opinions are my own . lynn grant

1			configuration	swap	windows	space	session	setup	directory	figure	march	file			 mathcad 4 . 0 swap file ? reposting and summarizing , for your information or additional comment . this is long i have 16mb of memory on my 386sx 25 mhz , an intel math coprocessor , and a 120mb hard drive with 20mb free no compression . i have been running mathcad 3 . 1 , under windows 3 . 1 in enhanced mode , with a 5mb ram drive , 2mb 1mb smart drive , and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months . i am interested in the faster mathcad 4 . 0 , but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsoft's claim about increased speed . to 386sx users will mathcad 4 . 0 run without a swap file , or insist that i use a swap file ? so far , in response to a less detailed description of my setup , or in unrelated postings , the more informed answers , on the net or by email , appear to be 1 by david a . fuess according to mathsoft , no. mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical resources . they say this is actually a win32s feature . a figure of 10mb was indicated to me as a minimum . but you might try anyway ! 2 by bert tyler i m not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here .  i have a 486 66dx2 with 16mb of main memory less 2mb for a ramdisk and a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process , which i have been running without any swapfile . when i installed the win32s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk , the win32s subsystem itself demanded the presence of a swapfile . the only win32s program i have run to date is the 32 bit version of freecell that came with that subsystem .  i gave windows a small temporary swapfile i m leery of files that must remain in fixed locations on my hard disk , and all seems well . 3 by brian c . anderson what is win32 ? i upgraded to mathcad 4 . 0 and it installed a directory for win32 under windows system . during the upgrade it told me that win32 was required . 4 by steven v case 1 mathcad 4 . 0 makes use of the win32s libraries . you have probably heard about win32s , it is a 32 bit windows library that provides much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and multitasking and such but can be run under windows 3 . 1 . 5 by thomas c . rhyne i also have 16 mb of ram , and indeed mathcad 4 . 0 insisted on a permanent swapfile ; it would not run otherwise . 6 by greg bishop 3 mathcad absolutely requires 4mb ram with 12mb swap file or 8mb ram with 8mb swap file . it will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file is less than 8mb . it is a major resource hog . if you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math , it takes about 5mb of ram real or virtual just to load again , due to the win32s libraries .   so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsoft's advertisement for 4 . 0 , that you need a swap file , possibly as big as 12mb . looks like i would just need an 8mb swap file , and would need to choose or can i ? between a faster permanent swap file , or a slower temporary swap file  apparently a win32 subsystem ships with mathcad 4 . 0 how much disk space does this require ?   i also received these answers 1 by dale hample if you have got 16 megs of ram , why not configure 10megs as a ram disk for mathcad ? dos 6 permits different bootup configurations .   can mathcad 4 . 0 win32 be configured to use such a ram drive instead of a swap file ? if not , i don not see how using dos 6 . 0 for an alternate bootup would provide windows with this swap file . some time back i remember a discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file , but i thought this involved slower , 8mb systems.  i have dos 6 . 0 but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation .  by the way , is a full installation of dos 6 . 0 required to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature ? which files from the installation disks are required ?   2 by wildstrom presumeably , you mean without a permanent swap file . if windows needs a swap file , it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn not exist permanent is generally faster though . i don not know why mathcad wouldn not be happy with either type ver . 3 . 0 is and so should any program conforming to the win specification .   so far , 16mb has been enough ram to avoid the overhead of running any swap file i have been running mathcad 3 . 1 under windows 3 . 1 without one .
2			space	arm	pitch	brave	hitter	fan	coach	baseball	player	team	play	score	game	pitcher			 game length was re braves update !   i agree with nick . what's the big deal about long games ? if you want to watch baseball , there's that much more baseball to watch . and yes , baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves .  first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball . the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches .  until six or seven years ago i was an enthusiastic fan of nfl football . last year i hardly watched a game . what turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game . a team scores . 2 . 5 minutes of commercials . kickoff . 1 . 5 minutes of commercials . three downs and a punt . 2 minutes of commercials . aaaaarrrrgh ! earlier in this thread i commented on larussa and the a's , whom i believe institutionalize slow play . i don not mind the cat and mouse game with rickey on first ; in fact , i rather enjoy it . similarly i would enjoy the battle with listach or lofton or polonia on first what i object to is when such games are played with karkovice on first , or when the game is a blowout . i don not mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation , or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration . what i object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity . when a game is exciting , these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game . when the delays happen with regularity , they become nuisances , just like the commercial breaks in football . i understand the nfl imposed a number of rule changes to speed up the games , basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster . that did not address the problem of the continuity of the game . it may have appeased the sponsors and the networks , but i would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans . similary , while some 3 hour baseball games bore me to tears , those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch . i doubt if anyone watching the braves giants game cared about gant stepping out . i doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present . i would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball . on the other hand , i wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with alderson larussa duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do . i sure wouldn not mind a little arm twisting there . the beastmaster  mark singer

5			church	apostle	christian	link	interpretation	russian	prayer	god	german	gift	bible			 satanic tounges i have a simple test i take several people who can speak only one language e.g. chinese , russian , german , english . then i let the gifted one start speaking in toungues . the audience should understand the gifted one clearly in their native language . however , the gifted one can only hear himself speaking in his own language . that would be neat , but nowhere in the bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this . if the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone , no matter what languages they know , there would be no need for the gift of interpretation , and i corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written . perhaps i would believe the gifted ones more if they were glorifying god rather than themselves . then perhaps we would witness a real miracle . that's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million christians world wide . sure , there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges , just as there are among those who do not have this gift . there were people like this in the corinthian church also . that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men . i would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges do so more often in private prayer than in public . link hudson there were apparently those in the early church who claimed that at pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given the ability to understand the apostles speaking in greek . clh

i prefer the companionship of a person , not a euphemism . oh , do please try not to be ludicrous . so significant other , a term i employed to avoid the awkward construction girlfriend or wife . because if she heard thankfully , you got the gender right . for i am not a deviant . a deviant is someone who does not fit an accepted norm . by that definition , i would certainly be a deviant , as bisexuality is not an accepted norm in american society so far . this term , of course , really has no negative aspects inherent in its denotation . i presume you intended it as a term of abuse . it's a great pity you feel such tactics to be necessary , but hardly surprising since you have no factual basis for your absurd beliefs . how disparaging you are towards political minorities , sexual deviants do not comprise a political minorit y . may i attempt to emulate your style of discourse with a term of abuse ? ahem . you addle pated jellyfish ! the post to which i responded was a highly amusing one in which you belittled homosexuals for having no political clout . i would be further amused if you would explain to me why having no political clout and constituting a political minority are different . and if she had any shred of self respect , she would be out the door . i only associate with girls who do indeed have self respect . but were and yet you call them girls ! the feminists would be up in arms. i to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as homosexuality , i would encourage her to indeed do so , and i would further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on the way out . who needs such an airhead ? cough , cough . well , well , you certainly are a fine , upstanding fellow , you are , sir . and like many fine , upstanding fellows , you have the reading comprehension of a dyslexic anteater . perhaps i should have been more explicit in pointing out that females constitute a political minority in this country when last i checked , and that your obvious lack of respect for these minorities equates to a lack of respect for women . that is , of course , a conceptual stretch of logic , but given your slow uptake as de monstrated so far , i figure we should start simple and work up . don not worry , you will get it  ! pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet where they belong . don not count on it , sweetheart . oh , i can not do anything but count on it . after all , it is inevitable , for it is part of the natural order of things . throughout history , nature has always asserted itself . don not be so arrogant as this is very true , this bit about nature asserting itself . homosexuality has always been a part of human society , and always will be , for that is the natural order . if you are naive enough to believe otherwise , go right ahead ; we will try not to snicker too loudly behind your back . inevitable . chortle . anyone would think you had some idea what you were talking about . i haven not seen fact one from you , and until i do you can just dispense with the bullshit , and tell us what we already know , that you are a clueless little slime mold with no concept of reality beyond the donna reed show . live a little , and then come back and tell us all about the natural order of things . you are in a bubble , and it's really going to rock your world when you come out . to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the nature of man where practically every other generation has failed . foolish and misguided . oh , this is too much . so which religious figure do you believe you are ? and how do you know so much about the nature of man ? you are almost too amusing to be worth the effort of crushing your pealike brain . greater men than you haven not been able to do this . the above most certainly will happen , no matter how much you may wish to pretend otherwise . gee , you sound awfully sure of yourself . methinks the bigot doth protest too much . admit it you are scared shitless that what you have been spoonfed all your sorry little life was wrong , and you are trying to escape that fear by a blind faith that you know , deep down , is based in nothing , nothing at all . go ahead , clutch your unfounded declaratives to your empty breast ; ignore the myriad of societies that have accepted homosexuality as equally valid or even mystical . ignore the solid , inescapable fact t hat we have existed as long as humans have . fear us . go ahead . laugh at us if it makes you feel better . we both know you are just whistling in the dark . there's one group that's stamped out whenever it appears , in any form , and that's the group of boneheads who fancy themselves morally superior . you are in that group , and you are slowly and steadily being stamped out . preach while you can , little man . it won not be long . moreover , i m not your sweetheart . that's the first truth you have told so far . i don not hate hets , sir . i m bisexual , and i embrace man and womankind alike . i have nothing against those who don not understand my love . but you deny its potency and validity . you would crush us all , human beings to a one , in your imagined divinity . it's fools like you that stir my ire . idiots with the small minds , who can not think for themselves , who know nothing about how the real world operates , and who hate because they are told what to do and do it like sheep , who hate everyone who refuses to be a sheep . you are not part of the norm . you are part of a minority yes , a minority ! with supreme , o erweening arrogance . your hubris will topple , because it always has , because those with intelligence know it to be a clown's costume . wow , that was pretentious ! i sometimes wonder why i waste my talents on zeroes like you . i really have no interest in continuing this effortless discussion ; after all , this is for me the proverbial battle of wits with an unarmed opponent . come back with some swords i.e. facts and we shall do battle . till then , begone from my sight . drewcifer ps you were very entertaining , however . have you considered taking this on the road ?

1			cambridge	chip	fan	isa			 cpu fans just got a 66mhz 486dx2 system , and am considering getting a fan for the cpu . the processor when running is too hot to touch so i think this is a stuff deleted my 66 dx2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me . i am using the pc power and cooling cpu cooler . this one has precision ball bearings in the motor . it has a pretty substantial heat sink ; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip . it attaches with peel off adhesive . this is a full size at case , so the fan has gravity in its favor . i would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go . all of the cpu fans that i know of are powered from a drive cable . there are other board type fans which are isa boards with a couple of fans mounted on them . they are powered by the slot . i don not know how effective they are ; maybe someone else could comment . the cpu is cool enough to touch with the pcp&c unit . pc connection at 800 243 8088 has them for 29 . 95 5 . 00 next day delivery . the y cord is 7 . 00 if you don not have a spare lead off the power supply . pcp&c make the best power supplies available imho .  channel 1 r cambridge , ma
3			state	motorcycle	truth	dod			 lead acid batteries & concrete ?  why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor ? i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year , to preserve them and i just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work , but they act like the two terminals are shorted . i asked a friend and he said that you should never do that , cause it ruins them , but he couldn not tell me why .  this topic was beaten to death a year or so ago .  the concrete is not the problem .  lead acid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long time , but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the problem . the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate . that's why the old wives tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery thermally . it you will set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam , it will self discharge even slower . the best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly , but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow cycle the charge in the battery . such mild exercising of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage . if you do remove the electrolyte , may sure you keep separate storage containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells when you refill the battery . this isn not so critical for a brand new battery in a fully charged state , but will maximize the restored output of an older battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for storage .   neal howard 91 xlh 1200 dod 686 computrac , inc richardson , tx doh 0000001200 355o33 std disclaimer my opinions are mine , not computrac's . let us learn to dream , gentlemen , and then perhaps we shall learn the truth . august kekule 1890
3			doctor	ice	building	mountain	price	figure	manufacturer	arm			 critique of pressure point massager originator robin volans as promised , below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog . i am very pleased with the results . the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles . much like a professional shiatsu masseur . the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck , back , legs and arms. pressure point massager a2623 $ 109 to order or receive a catalog , call 24 hours , 7 days 1 800 345 3371 or fax at 1 800 345 4021 .  note when i ordered the massager , the item number was different , and the price was $ 179 , not $ 109 . when i received it , i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one . i was quite annoyed to see a $ 70 difference in price . i called them about it , and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks and works exactly the same . he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one , using the price difference as a reason for return . in fact , since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in 3 days , he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives , then return the old one . very reasonable people .  i have long term neck , shoulder and back pain if i were a building , i would be described as structurally unsound . i have stretches and exercises to do that help , but the problem never really goes away . if , for whatever reason , i do not exercise for a while illness , not enough time , lazy , etc . the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone to further strain . even with exercise , i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track , which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p . t . the tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye . when my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub occipital muscles in particular the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged . i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage , not vibrate , my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that i could use by myself . no doctor visit or inconvenient p . t . appts for a week later would be needed to use it . i could get up in the middle of the night and use it , if necessary . i have been using it for about a week or so now , and love it . the base unit is about a 14 x 9 rectangle , about 3 3 4 high , with handles on each side , and it plugs into an average outlet . the two metal thumbs are about 1 1 2 in diameter and protrude about 2 1 2 above the base . the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable . they are located more toward one end , rather than centered see figure below . they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet . it can be used from either side . for instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it .          for the neck head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs . the handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with the arms wrists . since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time , and i don not have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me . for my back , i sit in a high backed kitchen chair , position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged , and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it . the pressure of leaning back holds it in place . if i want to massage the entire spine , i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it . for my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together with the balls , position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them . the tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don not pin it up first as far as i m concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely i will use do it . if there are multiple considerations hassles , i m more likely to not bother with it . not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased . the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles , however , i overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days . i laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped . after that , i was more gradual about applying pressure . at this point , the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me . it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out . i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although i cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy , since i have had it such a short time . i plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after , too . i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks , so this was very timely for me . this is the 1st product i have ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker . the catalog states they have been in business since 1976 . it contains quite a few health care products and , while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products , they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do . definitely a step above some other ones i have seen such as dr. leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom . i m only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here . i consider many of those products to be rip offs , particularly targeted toward the elderly , with dubious health benefits . i apologize for the length of this , but it's the kind of info i would like to know before ordering something thru the mail . robin coutellier northern telecom , mountain view , ca internet uucp portal ! ntmtv ! robin

secret purpose of falklands war secret purpose of falklands war ; with in visibility technology dr. beter audio letter 74 of 80 digitized by jon volkoff , mail address audio letter r is a registered trademark of audio books , incorporation , a texas corporation , which originally produced this tape recording . reproduced under open license granted by audio books , incorporation  this is the dr. beter audio letter r , 1629 k st nw , washington , dc 20006 . hello , my friends , this is dr. beter . today is april 30 , 1982 , and this is my audio letter r no. 74 . it's now been almost one month since war broke out in the south atlantic . on the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren , wind swept falkland islands and south georgia island . in reality , it's far more than that . the so called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation . during this month of april 1982 , fierce naval battles have taken place not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific . up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides . but as i say these words , the naval war in the southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface . beginning today , april 30 , a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy has begun . at the same time a counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area . to be effective , a blockade must be imposed over a period of time , but the royal navy does not have that much time . winter is overextended . having come this far , her majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from argentina . as a result the british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be . there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat . that reason , my friends , is that the royal navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month . up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the british fleet . only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses . to obtain that cover story , the british have no choice but to sail into combat ; but in doing so , they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained . in short , my friends , her majesty's navy has sailed into a trap . the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange , ironic echoes of the past for weeks now we have been hearing countless commentators referring to the british task force as an armada quote . the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description . the original spanish armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force , but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history and it was none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada . the original spanish armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of england's queen elizabeth i . the armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england . they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake . drake and his small , fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada by changing the rules of battle . the english fleet was equipped with new longer range guns , and it stayed upwind and out of reach . from there the english pounded , smashed , and shattered the big ships of the mighty armada . when it was all over , barely half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port . drake's defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world . it opened the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its expansion into a truly global empire . today , 400 years later , history seems to have come full circle . queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i , and now the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation . once again a so called armada is preparing for invasion , but this time the armada is british , not spanish . four hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day ; today , the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene . the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america . the defeat of the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain's naval supremacy , and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy . my three special topics for this audio letter are topic 1 the military secret of south georgia island topic 2 the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic 3 the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war . topic 1 when the falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot . for a century and a half since 1833 , the islands have been controlled by great britain . during that entire time , british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina . there have been countless threats by argentina to seize the islands , which it calls the malvinas , but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about them . the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the united states , and they are not much of a prize . after 150 years of occupancy , the falklands are home to fewer than 2 , 000 british settlers and a lot of sheep . in short , the remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over , and yet here we are watching another crisis take place . we are watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina . the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato's doorstep . instead , britain is throwing almost everything it's got at argentina aircraft carriers , cruisers , destroyers , submarines , assault ships you name it . luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight . wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed . ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force . the initial 40 ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70 . over two thirds of the entire royal navy has already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina . watching all this , a lot of people are asking what's this fight really all about ? the most popular answer suggested in the major media is oil . vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands , but that has been known for nearly 10 years . in no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month , and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island . south georgia island is 800 miles east of the falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it ; and compared to south georgia , the falklands are an island paradise . south georgia island is covered with rugged mountains , treacherous valleys , glaciers , and semi permanent snow . most of it is uninhabitable . on top of all that , argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island . in that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the falklands . in the early 1830s the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists . in 1833 the british expelled them and took over the island . for that and other historical reasons , argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina , not britain . but no such argument is possible for south georgia island . it has always been controlled by britain , never by argentina or spain . the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view . argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms. they were well aware ahead of time that far off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long . by seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat , as the island was retaken by britain . so the question is why did argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all ? my friends , the answers to all these questions are military , not political or economic . south georgia island possesses an enormous military secret . it's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island . the real reason for the so called falkland crisis is this secret installation , together with two other similar installations which i will describe shortly . the secret military complexes have been in existence for many years ; they are not new . what is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington . for the past two months i have been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify them . the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year 1982 ! it is this fast approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so called falklands crisis to erupt now . what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war . the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here namely , the rockefeller cartel and russia's new rulers in the kremlin are behind the present crisis . they are trying to ruin phase 3 of the project z war plan which i revealed last month . that phase is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war one . as i mentioned last month , the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world . the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war . having done that , they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused , safe and cozy in government war bunkers ! when the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted , the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries . they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open . they will confront the world with the only remaining fresh , up to date , powerful military force on earth ; and using that military power , they will become the undisputed rulers of the world that is , they plan to do all this , and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off nuclear war one in a matter of months . the rockefeller cartel and russia's new anti bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan . last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long ago . it has only been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united states government by the bolsheviks . since that time the united states government has been a house divided , torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions . but before that , the united states had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brothers . in 1961 the brothers launched a new long range plan for world domination . it was a two prong strategy , half visible and half secret , which i first described long ago in audio letter no. 28 . it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually . without repeating all the details , the basic idea was grandiose yet simple . by deliberately appearing weak , the rockefeller controlled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia . then the secret weapons , including superweapons , would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world . when they set the grand plan in motion in 1961 , the rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s . their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres . both superpowers , the united states and the soviet union , are located well up in the northern hemisphere ; so are the other full fledged nuclear powers great britain , france , red china , and india . by contrast , the strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far between . in other words , it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war . in an all out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war . but there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread . it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern hemispheres . in the northern half of our planet , cold air from the north pole works its way southward towards the equator , then it works its way back to the north as warm air . a mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet . northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone , but very little of the air changes places . the military conclusion , my friends , is this the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for generations to come ; but if the calculations are right , the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war . this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers . a quick look at the globe of the world shows why . the rockefeller cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii . as i discussed in my very first monthly audio letter , nelson rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during the war . he accomplished this as so called coordinator of hemispheric defense for then president franklin d . roosevelt . so that takes care of the south american continent and its natural resources . then there is the african continent . there , too , rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa , especially south of the equator . all this was thanks to the efforts of john d . rockefeller iii , as i detailed in audio letter no. 36 . looking around the globe , the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and new zealand . thanks to world war ii , both were wide open to the rockefellers . the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming war . by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war . then , as the northern hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust , the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces . in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the earth . in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war , some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass . for example , revolts against rockefeller domination would require troops not a blast from the beam weapons on the moon . the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy . a minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required one based in the south atlantic , the other in the south pacific . since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war , they could not be built in existing shipyards . new construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden . to hide an entire shipyard is no small task ; they take up a lot of space . on top of that , it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built . the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over all secret installation . finally , the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack ; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely , the secret navy might be wiped out . the combined requirements for secrecy , space , and protection against attack were formidable ; but one day in 1959 , while all these plans were still in the early stages of development , the answer presented itself . during a so called banking trip to sweden , david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port . the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water . the entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors . inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships . the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger , more secret , better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted . a survey of candidate sites was then initiated . the site survey covered coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere . many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong . other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator . still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby , making the desired level of secrecy impossible . finally , it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically . at last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected . in the south pacific , extreme southern new zealand was selected . this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no. 71 three months ago when i called attention to new zealand's extreme importance in the coming war . in order to obtain the necessary space , the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together . one is at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the water's edge . the other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island , which is off the tip of south island . the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt . anglem . the new zealand location met all the requirements . ever since world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even closer to the united states than to great britain . the location is far from the equator , and the installations are buried deep under mountains , protected from nuclear attack . they are also too deep to be reached by particle beam attacks , and the new zealand site is well situated to command the entire south pacific . in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found . that site , my friends , is south georgia island . it is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic . the tall , rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100 mile long island . it is controlled by great britain whose government , like that of new zealand , was willing to cooperate ; and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast the whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built , but britain took no chances . in 1965 the whaling station was closed down . since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists . construction of the secret naval facilities two in new zealand , one on south georgia island began in the early 1960's . the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities , such as the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain , colorado ; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland . in this way , the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction . the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged . like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement , the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up . when sealed , the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is ; and unlike most large construction projects , there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention . the man made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous , but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea . once the secret naval facilities were built , they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage . the fake disarmament of the united states during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task . from 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme . he was then secretary of defense robert mcnamara . all through the 60's mcnamara presided over the public paring back of america's visible military power . this included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards . what we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards . where it went , my friends , was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in new zealand and south georgia island ! the secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the united states . as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently , it is cheaper to build two ships at a time . that is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques . the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines . they are all nuclear powered nuclear subs ; nuclear cruisers ; nuclear destroyers ; and yes , nuclear aircraft carriers , three of them . a secret twin was built for the u.s.s . nimitz , for the u.s.s . eisenhower , and for the newly launched u.s.s . carl vincent . all have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns , so called , that we constantly hear about in the defense department ; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way ! the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear powered vessels . even so , the secret naval ships possess one key difference . last month i revealed that the so called stealth program has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield . this technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity . a whole new fleet of phantom war planes are now going into crash production that use this principle ; and , my friends , all of the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealth field equipment ! the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field . after nuclear war one , the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth . it would be perfect for the intended role of world domination . the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago , my friends , but three years ago they lost control of the united states military . now it's the american bolsheviks who are in control , and they are bent on war . these secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the falklands crisis . topic 2 in audio letter r no. 73 last month i described project z , the new bolshevik three phase strategy for nuclear war one . an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war room here in washington . it's a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow , followed by all out thermonuclear war with russia . having set off the holocaust , the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers . finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in stalemate , they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and her allies . activating phase 3 of their grand strategy , they plan to unveil their secret weapons , especially their secret naval fleets . with these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world . the united states as we know it will be dead and gone ; but in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves , this outcome will constitute victory . up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two months ago is still on track . they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year 1982 ! time is fast running out . the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war ; but , my friends , the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race . they have two deadly enemies , both of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks . one enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel ; the other enemy is the new anti bolshevik ruling clique in russia ; and now these two mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways . in audio letter no. 71 three months ago i reported that a limited , new anti bolshevik coalition was in the works between the rockefeller cartel and the russians . the january 26 meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva , switzerland , was a turning point in the formation of this coalition . it is now a reality , and is responsible for the so called falkland crisis now relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of a true alliance . they have very major disputes to be settled between them , but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy the bolsheviks here in america . the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war . if they can do that , time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no. 67 . a slow down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti bolshevik actions to be implemented . the joint rockefeller russian planners decided by mid february that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very quickly . no other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer . the exact details of the project z war plan are not known to are known to be as i described last month . it was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase 3 of the bolshevik war plan that is , the bolshevik controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled . by working together , the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone . the rockefeller group , who built and originally controlled these bases , provided detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them . the russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack . it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attacked . survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable . military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was out of the question . there was no combination of commandos , frogmen , or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world . any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent . but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter . in a way , the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles heel . the extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible . the key lay with argentina and her long standing claims to the falkland islands . as i mentioned in topic 1 , the rockefeller cartel has dominated all of latin america for decades . cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there . the historic dispute over the falkland islands was to be used to provide a ruse , a military cover , to enable the south georgia base to be attacked . the argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means , but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do . as an inducement to cooperate , the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards . they were guaranteed that after the shooting was over , the falkland islands would remain in argentine hands . this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the royal navy . and to bolster the troubled argentine economy , it was promised that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves . with these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards , the argentine military junta agreed to the plan . on march 19 argentina carried out act 1 in the joint attack plan . a group of argentine scrap metal merchants , of all things , landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia island . supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell . while they were at it they also raised the argentine flag over the work site . the british , always nervous about south georgia island , promptly reacted as expected . the british antarctic survey ship endurance put 22 marines ashore . they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the argentine flag . the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmering 150 year old falklands dispute to a boil . from time to time in the past , argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered that way by britain . that argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy . it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders , so there was no hint of what was really afoot . during late march , argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands . nothing new , thought the british high command . argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times . it was believed that they were about to do it again ; but on april 2 argentine forces did the unexpected . after many past false alarms , this time they actually invaded and seized the islands . all argentine public statements emphasized the long standing historical claims to the falklands themselves ; but just for good measure , the next day a small argentine force also seized far off south georgia island . the force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from argentina's point of view ; however , the small contingent of 22 royal marines were overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists . that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller russian attack plan . thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces , a special commando team got onto the island undetected . based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base , the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base . special high speed drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense . by late that evening , april 3 , the military high command in london finally learned what was really taking place . the secret south georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible . the joint rockefeller russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside . it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base . once the hole was made , the next step was obvious . the rockefeller russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole . the best guess was that it would be a nerve gas . the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british government on the evening of april 3 can hardly be described , my friends . the thatcher government , like the so called reagan administration here in america , is bolshevik controlled . that's why margaret thatcher always says , me , too any time the reagan administration says or does anything against russia . both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries , and on the evening of april 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep , deep trouble . immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic . haste was the order of the day . the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding around the clock . the best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks , on or about april 24 . if help did not reach south georgia by then , the secret installation might be doomed . the forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances . their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle . they did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons . to open the blast proof entrance doors would be suicide . on april 5 , just two days after south georgia island was seized , some 40 naval ships began moving out of british ports . the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister . he was forced to resign , my friends , because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack preparations . that same day , april 5 , new zealand , the home of the other secret naval fleet , broke diplomatic relations with argentina . the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on red alert . as a precautionary measure , all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea . several surface ships were already at sea undergoing sea trials , but that still left seven 7 major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier . on that busy day of april 5 , argentina's foreign minister , costa mendez , was at the united nations in new york . he was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy . costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials . he got them ! for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiations went on . that , my friends , was only a cover story . the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward south georgia island . if the task force arrived in time to save the secret base , a major battle was likely . the official stories about slow movement of the british armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle . if need be , the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island , then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule . in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved . it was initially expected that advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two weeks . that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed . but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan . key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april 14 , two days before it was announced officially . shortly after they did so , they ran into trouble . russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on south georgia island . the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation . in moments the ship was without any command , its communications and radar silenced . then a russian sub closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship with torpedoes . it broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly . so far as is known , there were no survivors . this unexpected shock in the mid atlantic produced two results , both important first , it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada . the task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense , but that cost valuable time . public announcements from london about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown . the timetable for arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching out longer and longer . all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island . the drilling continued . the other result of the sinking was equally important . word was flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action . it was obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic , which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble . during the dead of night , early april 15 , the seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern new zealand . they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipodes islands , 450 miles southeast of new zealand . their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack . these shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it , as i explained last month ; but once they arrived at the antipodes , the stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the island headquarters . the antipodes headquarters , in turn , was in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america . the deployment of the available ships of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint rockefeller russian planners had hoped for . the ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand ! the british ship's sinking of april 14 was also followed by other events . on april 15 the argentine navy started moving out of port . the same day , alexander haig arrived again in buenos aires . supposedly he was there as a diplomat , but in reality he was there as a general , dealing with generals . haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel , as i have revealed in the past he was making sure that the argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment . four days later , april 19 , haig left for washington . as he boarded his plane , haig somberly told reporters , time is running out . and so it was , my friends , for the secret south georgia base . the very next day , april 20 , the drill broke through into the hollowed out cavern of the naval base . bolshevik military analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend . the british fleet was still out of range . the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small , compact russian neutron bomb . when it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave , the effects were devastating . the intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base . also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them . meanwhile , russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands awaiting orders . from a distance , the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields , which also protect against beam weapon attack ; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the russians employed . floating overhead , the cosmospheres located the seven ships using their psychoenergetic range finding equipment known as prf . as i have reported in the past , there is no method known by which prf can be jammed . the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines . the subs were armed with special non homing , non nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact . more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship ; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode . within 15 minutes after the attack began , all seven bolshevik stealth ships were on their way to the bottom , and with them went their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world . the south pacific action took place just after sunset local time . the time here in washington was around 2 00 pm april 23 . that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public with the new british foreign minister , francis pym . pym was wearing the artificial pseudo smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public . but not haig . haig was grinning from ear to ear , and no wonder . the joint rockefeller russian military operation had been a brilliant success . the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out , bottled up inside south georgia island ; and the south pacific fleet , while not totally wiped out , had been badly crippled . by working together , the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere . topic 3 as i say these words , news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic , but the real war in the southern hemisphere is already over . what we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath . that aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands . they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war . at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing for a public announcement that the united states will side with britain . as soon as that takes place , military action will heat up fast around the falklands . britain has no choice but to fight . she has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle ; but by fighting , the bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the royal navy . meanwhile , the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast building , anti nuclear war campaign . on all sides now we are hearing about the so called nuclear freeze movement . there are documentaries , articles , publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war . in recent months , there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue . medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war . we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously . we are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before , yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time . if you believe that , my friends , i give up . movements like this never , and i mean never , develop without leadership , organization , and money and plenty of it . what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work . as i have explained in the past , the rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place . if it does , they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it . instead , the deadly enemies of the rockefeller cartel , the bolsheviks here , will win out if there is a war ; and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war . the present anti nuclear war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and russia ; but as russia's new rulers know very well , this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group . it's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers . the russians regard the united states as a house divided , and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the rockefellers . their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all out , even suicidal , nuclear war ; but once that is done , they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day . the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti nuclear war propaganda . that objective is renewed power and power that moves them closer to their old dream of world government . the bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign . under bolshevik control , the so called reagan administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people . the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power . these days the smell of war is in the air . the falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense . the rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war . a new super united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill . it will have teeth ! as presently envisioned , the new organization will be based in geneva , switzerland . the working name , though this may be changed , is the world nonproliferation council . the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties , but its true purpose will be to use fear the fear of war to control us all . last minute summary now it's time for my last minute summary . in this audio letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so called falkland islands crisis . the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevik controlled naval installations in the southern hemisphere . these have been attacked by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear war timetable . the attacks were successful , but the results remain to be seen . one result , though , is that the royal navy has now been drawn into a trap . britain's waterloo at sea may well be at hand . my friends , two factions are struggling for control over our united states the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks . they differ in style but both seek to control us through fear . if we are ever to rise above their trickery , it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ , our only hope . as the scripture tells us , our lord . has not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , of love , and of a sound mind . we must learn to wage peace . as our lord declared long ago , blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god . until next month , god willing , this is dr. beter . thank you , and may god bless each and every one of you . 

2			german	game	cup	country	goalie	television	russian	player	sport	team	puck			 german audience is lunatic ?  i watched the game germany czechs in wc today . and i was astonished about the behaviour of the german audience ! the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy ! they threw coins , extra pucks and other trash into the rink . is that stupid or what ? i guess the canadian referee one of the isostar bros ; gave the german team a penalty for that , but it didn not help much . i guess the germans just are proud over their nazi kill em all everyone but us germans sucks attitude . they just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer it really pisses me off ! i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks , but most of them seem to do . i can understand your anger about the german audience . i mean , it was the finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the canadien ref called in the last period . the germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the german goalie got two minutes for delay of game for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd . the resulting 5 3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point , when the germans were starting to come up strong . i am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in german sports events . if you watch for example a tennis davis cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes , because the crowd is so obnoxious . but i have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries you should go to the us and watch the way they present the olympics on television ; or the soccer crowds in england ; or the finnish spectators at nordic skiing events . i mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and i would rather see the best team player win and get cheared at . i do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and i have to admit that in most sports the german national site is not my favorite team to watch the german soccer team is boring to watch , for example . but , reading the above posting , i think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing . it is easy to talk of nearly all germans as nazis and nationalists ; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against germany . it is true that there is a great danger of re arising nationalism in germany but from my experience most of the people at least of the people that i know also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now . why can not we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality eg . all russians are communists ; all americans are capitalists ; all germans are nazis , all fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries . in my opinion , your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you don not seem to be different from the nazis you are talking about . thomas there's no time to hate , barely time to wait jerry garcia robert hunter

4			minority	gun	german	weapon			 jffo has gone a bit too far would somebody please post evidence that the gun control act of 1968 is a verbatim transcription of a nazi law ? the evidence is that the two laws are basically identical . however , that's not evidence that one is a copy of the other . there's no evidence that the 68 gca's authors used the nazi law as a guide . yes , they ended up with roughly the same thing , but that comes from their shared goal , disarming those menacing minorities . i thought the same thing too , until jpfo's rkba article in the latest guns & ammo at the newstands . this article makes it certain that sen . thomas dodd d md ? back before 1968 definitely asked for a translation of the german weapons laws back then . read the article , and see what you think of jpfo's argument . they note that ted kennedy and john dingell are among the three of the originals left from the 1968 stuff , and they are asking that folks request of john dingell that he introduce legislation to lift gca 68 , something which i would support whole heartedly ! andy can someone post a general idea of what gca 68 does ? thanks .

1			directory	setup			 multiple printers through print manager print manager how does print manager deal with multiple printers ? we are planning . . to print to two printers from an application . one will be a real printer , and the other a . fax program . . will print manager just deal with the jobs one at a time , or will it feed to both printers at once ?  please research carefully . just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a local machine , doesn not guarantee functionality when a local machine has fax software printing to a remotely installed fax card i tried this with workgroups and the fax software didn not like it at all . could have been winfax's peculiarisms but i don not think so . a lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally . in my case , a fax manager program merely intercepts the print job and spools it to it's own directory , not print manager's spool directory . to software , it appears the job was printed . print manager plays no part in the handling of the actual process . pardon me if i have incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to . a truely network aware fax modem will most likely be required , or a lot of weird setup and tinkering . good luck .

5			circuit			 there must be a creator ! maybe  science is wonderful at answering most of our questions . i m not the type to question scientific findings very often , but . personally , i find the theory of evolution to be unfathomable . could humans , a highly evolved , complex organism that thinks , learns , and develops truly be an organism that resulted from random genetic mutations and natural selection ? . stuff deleted . computers are an excellent example . of evolution without a creator . we did not create computers . we did not create the sand that goes into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into processor board we took these things and put them together in an interesting way . just like plants create oxygen using light through photosynthesis . it's a much bigger leap to talk about something that created everything from nothing . i find it unfathomable to resort to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists we simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings if there even were beginnings at all . and that's ok with me . the present keeps me perfectly busy . jim halat

4			condition	state	improvement			 limiting govt was re employment was re why not concentrate . my $ . 02 news software vax vms vnews 1 . 4 b1  . it is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  you seem to be saying that a limited government will provide more opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own agendas , and asking libertarians to prove that this will not happen . while i can not offer such a proof , it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area , it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area . i rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have now that is more likely to become such a tool , and that it is such a tool in many instances .  pardon me for interrupting , but why doesn not anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government , less government , or no government and stop there ? it seems to me that the problems with society go much deeper than government . democracies seem to reflective of the majority of society , both the good and the bad . if you take away the government , you still have the structural flaws in society , except this time , with no restraints . yes ? no ? why doesn not anybody ever discuss communal society , like a kibbutz ? i never studied it on depth , but from what i have heard , the kibbutz in isreal was very successful . it is also very close to what aristotle and socrates believed was the best sorry to detract from the discussion . just as marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to wither away , libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition .  i suspect that this is because improvement in the human condition as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism , and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government . my impression of libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of government coercion except in a very limited cases . but what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human condition ? who would ever support the change if you tell them it won not improve their lives ? i know that there are , and will be , libertarians who will jump in now and say that it will improve our lives . i can deal with that . all i m saying is that improving the human condition must be the primary goal of any organization . ian sutherland   who said anything about panicking ? snapped authur . garrett johnson this is still just culture shock . you wait till i have settled into the situation and found my bearings . then i will start panicking ! douglas adams

5			disciple	god	mary	season	understanding	faith	jesus	bible	paul	doctrine	belief	state	james	love	satan	christian	roman			 so far so good  this may be a really dumb one , but i will ask it anyways christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of god , right ? i may be wrong , but that is my understanding but they still try to do it . doesn not it seem like we are spending all of our lives trying to reach a goal we can never achieve ? i know that we are saved by faith and not by works , but does that mean that once we are saved we don not have to do anything ? i think james tells us that faith without works is dead paraphrase . how does this work ?  so long as we think that good things are what we have to do rather than what we come to want to do , we miss the point . the more we love god ; the more we come to love what and whom he loves .  when i find that what i am doing is not good , it is not a sign to try even harder romans 7 14 8 2 ; it is a sign to seek god . when i am aware of jesus presence , i usually want what he wants . it is his strenth , his love that empowers my weakness .  stan armstrong . religious studies dept , saint mary's university , halifax , n . s . att ! clyde ! watmath ! water ! dalcs ! armstrng i apologize to the moderator , but the first quote was deleted and i would like to respond to both . as for the goal we can never achieve , the reward comes from the trying . paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in philippians 3 10 16 . only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm , to be spit out by jesus . as it says in 1 john 5 3 this is love for god to obey his comands . that obedience is our straining to achieve for god . of course , this requires work on our part . as for the quote in james , satan doesn not care what we believe . what matters is the results of our belief works . if one truly has faith in what one believes , one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place . stan , as for your first line , you have a very good point . obedience by obligation grudgery is not what god desires . instead , look at how many times the bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing god's work . being begrudged by the work has no value . also , we should do the work necessary whenever we can , not just when we feel jesus presence . feelings can deceive us . however , as paul states to timothy in 2 timothy 4 2 preach the word ; be prepared in season and out of season ; correct , rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction . also , remember that paul tells timothy in 1 timothy 4 16 watch your life and doctrine closely . persevere in them , because if you do , you will save both yourself and your hearers . so , in order to do the work necessary , we need to be sure that we are correct first remember jesus warning in matthew 7 3 5 not to be hypocritical about what we do . the best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed . joe fisher

turkey volume ii reform , revolution & republic the rise of modern turkey , 1808 1975 . london , cambridge university press 1977 . pp . 315 316 . in april 1915 dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city of van , whose 33 , 789 armenians comprised 42 . 3 percent of the population , closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire . leaving erivan on april 28 , 1915 , armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days . knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions , armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims. armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state , the ottoman empire , and to assist instead other invading russian armies . their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories . armenian political leaders , army officers , and common soldiers began deserting in droves . with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i , the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations , who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies . . meanwhile , czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans , with the president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious russian army , with their blood to serve the victory of russian arms . let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the bosporus . let , with your will , great majesty , the peoples remaining under the turkish yoke receive freedom . let the armenian people of turkey who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of russia . 155 armenians again flooded into the czarist armies . preparations were made to strike the ottomans from the rear , and the czar returned to st petersburg confident that the day finally had come for him to reach istanbul . 155 horizon , tiflis , november 30 , 1914 , quoted by hovannisian , road to independence , p . 45 ; fo 2485 , 2484 46942 , 22083 . ottoman

appeared that with the muslim natives dead or driven away , it might be able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient armenian civilization . an armenian legion was organized not o expel the turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted russian drive into the bitlis vilayet . 162 thousands of armenians from mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new armenian state . by mid july there were as many as 250 , 000 armenians crowded into the van area , which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than 50 , 000 people , muslim and non muslim alike . 163 162 hovannisian , road to independence , p . 56 ; fop 2488 , nos . 127223 and 58350 . 163 bva , meclis i vukela mazbatalari , debates of august 15 17 , 1915

but you perhaps feel free to make these minor adjustments in the name of truth . i went through this just a few weeks ago ; here it comes again . the entire turkish population of armenia which armenians called tartars constituted at least about 40 of the total population of armenia was deliberately exterminated . for the population statistics , please look to the book of richard hovannessian , armenia on the road to independence . i listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one armenian , one american , and one british . they are men are like that by leonard r . hartill ; adventures in the near east by a . rawlinson ; world alive , a personal story by robert dunn . also , i personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two armenians and also one american . the official british report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents lord curzon aharonin interview is the report of the british high commissioner to caucasia , sir oliver wardrop . an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at least 30 40 percent of the population of that republic . the memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and eye witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in 1926 with the title men are like that . other references abound . rachel a . bortnick the jewish times june 21 , 1990 need i go on ? serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes

3			format	satellite	guard	series	advance			 how does differential mode gps work ? explaination of dgps system gps , differential , navigation , radio i understand that the new gps boxes now have an option known as differential ready . apparently land based beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps receiver with differential option installed . how does this system work ? what frequency is used for the land based beacons ? thanks in advance , charlie thompson . here's a rough sketch of how the system works . a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals . these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion , sa selective availability time dithering , etc. the reference unit contains complex computational equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows where it is already . it then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers . if the receivers are nearby 300km and are using the same satellites as the reference unit , the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit . thus , the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit . the us coast guard is currently as far as i know installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps . these stations will use existing radio towers . i believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 khz . there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies . for example , pinpoint 310 618 7076 offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us . the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm 104 format . advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors .  john p . baker my opinions are my own . i don not know johns hopkins university anyone else who wants them , anyway . applied physics laboratory laurel , md 20723

3			fire	medicine	patient	candida	violation	infection	yeast			 candida yeast bloom , fact or fiction oxygen just like it does in the vagina . as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l . acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections , i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out .  i have mentioned this study a couple of times now ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis , annals of internal medicine , 3 1 92 116 5 353 7 . do you have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than capsules of lactobacillus even though it had positive results ?  the study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of yogurt . there was a marked decrease in infections while women were ingesting the yogurt . problems with the study included very small numbers 33 patients enrolled and many protocol violations only 21 patients were analyzed . still , the difference in rates of infection between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly believable .  david rind david , this study looks like a good one . gordon rubenfeld did a medline search and also sent me the same reference through email . since commercial yogurt does not always have a good lactobacillus a . or bulgaricus culture , a negative finding would not have been too informative . this is often the reason why lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt . i guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoir a fact that gordon r . vehementy denys ? i see two possible theories . one , the l . acidophilus , which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium , could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida . this would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though . the other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses it's major food source . getting lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract where it is normally found would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though . an acetic acid , lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but i have not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature . this would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients . when this is done in private practice , the results are rarely , if ever published . it was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials . it really raises a big question . does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way . this particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved even the anti fungals are not all that dangerous . but there are some areas like edta chelation therapy , where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned . it's really tough . do i follow only well established protocols and then give up if they don not work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn not been proven to work yet ? my stand is to consider other treatment possibilities , especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient . getting good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility . the other is getting l . acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a problem with recurring yeast infections . marty b .
2			improvement	wire	tie	tank	bike	cage	sport	car	lane	fire			 airhorns on an fj1100 review for those of you who are thinking about fiamms , you might also want to think about airhorns . i just installed a set of bosch air horns ordered from dennis kirk pg . 282 of the latest catalog on my 85 fj1100 . they are rated at 93db at 7 meters . i installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground . my stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine . i soldered the connections to the relay and compressor , and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse connector from napa . i installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing . you have to remove the front fairing to do this , but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses . depending how tight your fairing follows the frame , you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing . the compressor is about 2 in diameter and about 5 long . the relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it . i found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount . the horns fit inside the front fairing frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops , but behind the turn signals . the back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame . there is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance , and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into . the short horn is even with the fairing , and the long one sticks out about an inch or so , but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely . they end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you . if you have any other questions about the mounting , email , and i can try to explain better . if your bike is not red , then you may want to paint them first how do they work you ask ? they are very , very , very loud . they sound more like a european sports car than a truck , but a vast improvement over stock . i have used them at least daily since installing them , and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet although , the duration of the horn blasts have been short . i have repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them , even though they know that i have the horns , they still jump . they are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk . the bottom line is they work , are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages as well as take a few years off their lives and are relatively easy to install on the fj . ymmv . tjk 85 fj1100 with get out of my way horns . that looks like a suit you would fight a fire in comment about the aerostich
2			configuration	car			 mr2 noisy engine . in a previous article , eliot says are there any mr2 owners or motor head gurus out there , that know why my mr2's engine sounds noisy ? the mr2's engine is noisy at the best of times , but not even a nice nose it's one of those very ugly noises .  assuming yours is a non turbo mr2 , the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 4 that doesn not have balance shafts . i guess toyota didn not care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling .  myself , i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no balance shafts . it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine .  if the noise really bugs you , there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a v6 .   eliot nice theory . too bad the mr2's never came with a four cylinder over 2 . 0 liters . more like 1 . 6 . or did they ? were the nonturbo mr2ii's 2 . 2 or some such ? i also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders , must pay saab a royalty for using their patented design . like porsche's 3 . 0 i4 . c ya drew

according to raffi r kojian , armenians and jews are blatantly lying ? sedar , it is 'serdar , kocaoglan . your second quote by sahak melkonian is very frankly invented . just love it . well , it could be your head wasn not screwed on just right . if that does ever happen , look out the window and see if there is a non fascist x soviet armenian government in the east in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul . it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves . it certainly is possible to severe the artificial life support system of an imagined ethnic purity that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land . sahak melkonian 1920 preserving the armenian purity if you are going to lie and invent quotes at least use the right date . you sound like asala sdpa arf idiots clowns crooks . if you prefer to imagine that u.s. ambassador bristol and armenian jewish scholars were trying to mislead arromdians , be my guest a typical armenian clown . source u.s. library of congress bristol papers general correspondence container 34 . while the dashnaks x soviet armenian government were in power they did everything in the world to keep the pot boiling by attacking kurds , turks and tartars ; by committing outrages against the moslems ; by massacring the moslems ; and robbing and destroying their homes . during the last two years the armenians in russian caucasus have shown no ability to govern themselves and especially no ability to govern or handle other races under their power . source general bronsart wrote as follows in an article in the july 24 , 1921 issue of the newspaper deutsche allgemeine zeitung since all the moslems capable of bearing arms were in the turkish army , it was easy to organize a terrible massacre by the armenians against defenseless people , because the armenians were not only attacking the sides and rear of the eastern army paralyzed at the front by the russians , but were attacking the moslem folk in the region as well . source john dewey , the turkish tragedy , the new republic , volume 40 , november 12 , 1928 , pp . 268 269 . they armenians boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war , and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population . armenia was not a soviet republic in 1920 ! so sorry to burst your little bubble . what a clown . let us ask armenian scholars shall we ? source hovannisian , richard g . armenia on the road to independence , 1918 . university of california press berkeley and los angeles , 1967 , p . 13 . the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over 130 , 000 square miles . the estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4 , 700 , 000 , of whom 940 , 000 20 percent were armenian , 1 , 200 , 000 25 percent georgian , and 2 , 220 , 000 45 percent moslem . of the latter group , 1 , 140 , 000 were tatars . paradoxically , barely one third of transcaucasia's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia , where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds . erevan uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44 , 000 armenians as compared to 68 , 000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897 , however , the armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the guberniia ; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670 , 000 of the 1 , 120 , 000 inhabitants . this impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic , a solid block of 370 , 000 tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia . see also map 1 . historic armenia and map 4 . administrative subdivisions of transcaucasia . in 1920 , 0 percent turk . we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . our troops surrounded village after village . little resistance was offered . our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . some of the tartars escaped of course . they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey . the rest were killed . and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages . they are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . ohanus appressian men are like that p . 202 . as for your other quote , i would love to know the source . just say so . source men are like that by leonard ramsden hartill . the bobbs merrill company , indianapolis 1926 . 305 pages . memoirs of an armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2 . 5 million muslim people foreword for example , we were camped one night in a half ruined tartar mosque , the most habitable building of a destroyed village , near the border of persia and russian armenia . during the course of evening i asked ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction . in his matter of fact way he replied , yes , i assisted in its sack and destruction , and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to day scattered among its ruins . p . 202 first and second paragraphs . we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . our troops surrounded village after village . little resistance was offered . our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . some of the tartars escaped of course . they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey . the rest were killed . and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages . they are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . p . 15 second paragraph . the tartars were , for the most part , poor . some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms ; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers . they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley , from plain to mountain , and from mountain to plain , following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons . they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains . even the village tartars are a primitive people , only semicivilized . i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars , and , while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country , regarded and treated them as inferiors . the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars , far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors , intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility . p . 20 second paragraph . our men armed themselves , gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village . there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred , for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear . our men hammered on the doors , but got no response ; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain . throughout the hideous night , i cowered at home in terror , unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men . by morning the work was finished . p . 109 second paragraph . as things were , the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience ; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means . the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law . when they became a legally instituted , recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands , they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days . the outstanding feature of their rule , now that they were in power , was , as in the old days , trial and execution without hearing . a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him . the method of execution was for a government mauserist to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street , place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains . this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts . p . 203 first paragraph . a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar . i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back . another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar's head with it . the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet , wrested the weapon from the tartar's body , and , raising it to his lips , licked it clean of blood , exclaiming in russian , 'slodkey ! slodkey ! sweet . p . 203 second paragraph . one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village . among the ruins a fire was burning . i went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers . among them were two tartar girls , mere children . the girls were crouched on the ground , crying softly with suppressed sobs . lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of tartar peasant homes . there were also bodies of the dead . p . 204 first paragraph . i was soon asleep . in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of a child . i arose and went to investigate . a full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted . guided by the child's crying , i entered the yard of a house , which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a turkish family . there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead . her throat had been cut . lying on her breast was a small child , a girl about a year old . p . 118 . slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow , the cart jolting and the loads swaying . boys ran along the line of oxen , encouraging them with shrill tartar cries , and belaboring the beasts with sticks . in the carts , the women , veiled as is the tartar way , held children in their arms. wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold . a few old men plodded along on foot . across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown . the leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted . the gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire . women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts , screamed , ran and sought vainly for safety . this massacre was not complete . the armenian soldiers in the near by barracks , hearing the firing and the turmoil , hurried to the scene . that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed . p . 192 . great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding places on the retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced . they entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the turks . p . 193 . terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars , kurds and turks . their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country . p . 195 . the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity tartars , kurds and russians . p . 218 . first and second paragraphs russian troops did terrible things in the turkish villages . we armenians did not spare the tartars . if persisted in , the slaughtering of prisoners , the looting , and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course . i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground , in numbers , like the fallen leaves in a forest they had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep . they had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle , fired with ardor and courage , with weapons in their hands , and exchanging blow for blow . they had died as the helpless must , with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself . p . 133 first paragraph in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians abandoned the struggle . during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death . i was sickened by the brutality displayed , but could not make any effective protest some , mercifully , were shot . many of them were burned to death . the method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut , and then after crowding the hut with turks , set fire to the straw . p . 19 first paragraph the tartar section of the town no longer existed , except as a pile of ruins . it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered . the same fate befell the tartar section of khankandi . p . 22 second paragraph many of our men had served in the russian army , and were trained soldiers . we armenians were rich and possessed arms. tartars had never received military training . they were poor , and possessed few arms beyond knives . . shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village , the revolution in russia was suppressed . p . 97 third paragraph within a few years , following the beginning of the movement , an invisible government of armenians by armenians had been established in turkish armenia in armed opposition to the turkish government . this secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called mauserists professional killers to enforce its decrees . p . 98 first paragraph the dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the turkish government . p . 98 third paragraph . the dashnacks engineered a general revolt of armenians in turkish armenia under the mistaken belief that european nations would intervene and secure independence for turkish armenia . p . 99 second paragraph the dashnacks were fanatics . p . 99 third paragraph the dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the russian province . they instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich armenians . a wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum . refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death . every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question . if a man were to be assassinated , lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the mauserists of the party . p . 130 first paragraph . in moments of victory against turks and kurds or tartars , they armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance . p . 130 third paragraph the city was a scene of confusion and terror . during the early days of the war , when the russian troops invaded turkey , large numbers of the turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the russian advance . p . 159 second paragraph i made a cannon , a huge gun to lift which required four men . i made balls for it . with my cannon the armenians could knock down any of the tartar houses and so they were able to drive the tartars out . p . 181 first paragraph the tartar villages were in ruins . p . 189 third paragraph the dead tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood , his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned . need i go on ? serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ohanus appressian 1919 in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single

4			murder	violation	police	right	state	crime	bullet	officer	assault	concern			 rodney king trial , civil rights violations , double jeopardy  furthermore , what are the specific charges against the four lapd officers ? which civil rights or laws are they accused of violating ?  i believe it is a general charge , that is no specific right is mentioned . i don not think that this is accurate . i believe , and could be wrong , that there is a specific right allegedly to have been violated , like the 14th or due process or whatever . what about double jeopardy ? has there been any concern that a verdict against koon , et al . might be overturned upon appeal because they are being tried again for the same actions ? i thought i heard something on the news about this .  the ss has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in essence seperate sovereigns , then double jeopardy does not apply .  if this is true , then could defendents also be tried under city and county governments ?  this mornings paper said that the aclu has decided to reinstate its opposition to this kind of thing . they had earlier suspended their opposition while they examined the king case . there might be hope for the aclu after all .  double jeopardy does not apply , but not for the reasons you quote . double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge . however , the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault . they are now on trial for the different crime of violating mr. king's civil rights . as for the city and county or state trying you more than once , it most likely will not happen . this is because cities and states have separate laws governing behaviour . for example , in some states , it is an offence to carry marijuana , but not a city offence . also , i think murder is against federal , but not some state laws .  ! ! 1 1 ! 1 1 1 and my mind was filled with wonder , ! 1 1 richard cory went home last night , ! and put a bullet through his head . !

5			religion	relationship	faith			 if there were no hell  fear based religion is not a faith relationship with the one who made us all .  so does that mean that anyone who is a christian to avoid hell isn not really a christian at all ? it sounds like it to me . if that's the only reason , i would be inclined to doubt whether or not what they profess is christianity . the relationship of faith is based upon trust fear and trust are generally incompatible . if my only motivation is fear , is there room for trust ? if so , there's room for faith . if fear precludes trust , then there can not be faith . larry overacker   lawrence overacker shell oil company , information center houston , tx 713 245 2965

3			patient	disease	medicine			 persistent vs chronic chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis , or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests . the degree of elevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial , or as much as ten times normal . other blood chemistries are usually normal . as a rule , patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease . chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic , at least initially , and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy . the patient with cph only needs to be reassured . the patient with cah needs to be treated . i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis . it seems that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis , whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah viral , drugs , alcohol , autoimmune , etc . physicians seem to have a variety of thresholds for electing to biopsy someone's liver . personally , i think that if the patient is asymptomatic , with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and pt , one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy . others may well biopsy such a patient , thus providing these samples for study . it would be interesting to see if anyone's done any decision analysis on this .   kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine . dammit , not a programmer !
3			doctor			 thyroidal deficiency she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary ? tests and her values were regarded as low . the doctor and my wife are not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the gland , giving life long dependency to the drug hormone ? this is ridiculous , and your doctor sounds like a nut , if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said . if your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic , she will need insulin replacement . that doesn not mean she's dependent on insulin , anymore than she was beforehand if her body doesn not make enough , she will have to get it elsewhere . oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism , and it's really the only effective therapy available anyway . plus , it's cheap . taking thyroid hormone when it isn not needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone , but that's a feature , not a bug , and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism , because her problem that her gland isn not producing enough . there isn not a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids , so there should be no worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland . the last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp ? and been given some drops to re activate either her thyroidal gland and or the message center in the brain sorry about the approximate language , but i haven not got many clues to what the english terms are , but the brain area is called the hypofyse in norwegian . homeopathy is nonsense . tell her to stop wasting her money , health and time , and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy .  steve dyer aka ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c ! spdcc ! dyer

5			salvation	sin	jesus	existence	grace	right	christ	sinner	cheer	christian	god			 a kind and loving god ! these laws written for the israelites , god's chosen people whom god had expressly set apart from the rest of the world . the israelites were a direct witness to god's existence . to disobey god after knowing that god is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable . remember , these laws were written for a different time and applied only to god's chosen people . but jesus has changed all of that . we are living in the age of grace . sin is no longer immediately punishable by death . there is repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ and not just for a few chosen people . salvation is available to everyone , jew and gentile alike .  jews won not agree with you , malcolm .  cheers , kent  . alink ksand private activities on the net . a lot of people won not agree with me . that's their right and i respect that . however , to the point , jews are also covered by the saving grace of jesus christ there are jews who have become christians . this brings up another question i still have to ponder why is there so much anti semitism ? why do people hate jews ? i don not hate jews . i consider them to be like anyone else , sinners we all are .

4			game	country	border	truth	weapon	neighbor	engineer	citizen	state	war			 ten questions about israel  subject ten questions about israel   ten questions to israelis   i would be thankful if any of you who live in israel could help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions . these are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me . i lived there until july 1992 so i think that on the whole , my input is relevant . 1 . is it true that the israeli authorities don not recognize israeli nationality ? and that id cards , which israeli citizens must carry at all times , identify people as jews or arabs , not as israelis ? those are two separate questions . obviously , israeli authorities do recognize israeli nationality for some purposes , e.g. passports , consular services , etc . id cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above . ostensibly , this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov not , though this is not the general case . 2 . is it true that the state of israel has no fixed borders and that israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the state of israel should be ? from its onset , israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace . as such , the israeli gov not has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors . there is no plan for ultimate borders is this a game like ultimate frisbee ? extending into other countries . 3 . is it true that israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? if so , could you provide any evidence ? aside from what vaanunu provided , no. 4 . is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities , the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ? if that is true , then by virtue of the question's subject , it is unanswerable . anyone who claims its validity . is claiming an oxymoron . that having been said , i deny the above . you go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias . questions of the sort is it true that you entered your mother's vagina ? which are based upon some kernel of truth , though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon israel . incidentally , the answer to the above is usually yes , unless you were born via a c section .  shai guday stealth bombers , os software engineer thinking machines corporation the winged ninjas of the skies . cambridge , ma

1			menu	file	configuration	windows	screen	facility	desktop	setting	key	window			 workspace managers for win 3 . 1 a small review thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows 3 . 1 . i found 3 shareware workspace managers , from australia's ms windows archive monu6 . cc . monash . edu . au , which mirrors some sites in the u.s. the three i found were 1 . workspaces 1 . 10 wspace . zip this was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that i found . it is very easy to use . it displays a small window , containing 6 buttons , plus an extra button for configuration purposes . one annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run you must press a key not a mouse button ! for the thing to go away . also , it would have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons . maybe some user specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature . the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package . 2 . workshift 1 . 6 wrksft16 . zip while this workspace manager offered a few features that workspaces 1 . 10 lacked , it was quite time consuming to set things up . with workspaces 1 . 10 , all but the first workspace is initially empty . with workshift 1 . 6 , you need to take snapshots of how you want each of your workspaces to look like i.e. what applications they contain . also , the main window is quite large , but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace . with workspaces 1 . 10 , there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it . workshift 1 . 6 provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful . 3 . bigdesk 2 . 30 and backmenu backdesk . zip this is an interesting package , which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager . other goodies include backmenu , which provides a pop up root menu when you press a certain mouse button just like in x windows . the menu is totally configurable , offering unlimited depth of cascading menus , which is provides quite handy access to applications . you could say it is a menu based alternative to the program manager . also bundled in backdesk . zip is a program called wrun , which allows you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows instead of using the file manager to run applications . the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk 2 . 30 . bigdesk works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesn not provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces . in fact , it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount , and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on . this means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions , unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one . the bigdesk control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop . basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow up of a particular section . try each of them out for yourself . i was impressed with all of them , so find out which one suits your needs the best

3			right	police	amendment	condition	agency	communication	chip	wiretap	cryptography	session	algorithm	space	escrow	key	clipper	scheme	encryption	arm	religion			 more technical details hmm , followup on my own posting . well , who cares . first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper chip , from what hellman and denning were able to tell us the chip itself is not confined to digital telephony , but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner . the chip supports cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is , the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of whatever , and takes 80 bit keys . input data seems to be 64 bit ? yes . so if two people want secure communication whatever that means when clipper is involved they have first to agree on one secret key . or is it one key per direction ? they can exchange this key via dh schemes or however . somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper chip which is now ready to work . the clipper chip carries an unique serial number 30 bit's , and 160 key bits . these 160 key bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial number with 160 seed bits . the seed bits seem not to be stored in the chip at beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin ? before sending the fist real 64 bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put's out packets i guess 3 which represent the serial number , and the session key . this might look like x e k ; chipkeyk1 k2 , serial number where x is a transformation of these 3 ? packets involving a family key . this family sp ? key is equal for all chips . x might be a simple xor ? after that , the digital ? phone call can be done as usual , every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper . denning describes how k1 and k2 shall be generated , using a seed of 160 bit's . now , leaving alone politics , which does not concern me as much as you , not being an american citicien tm , there are some weak points in this scheme , which might be exploited by several parties . as far as i know about the generation of k1 , k2 ; s1 and s2 look like the obvious backdoor . they could be used to generate the chip keys by knowing the serial number and also the family key of the chip . i really can not imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise , as true random sources for the generation of the k1 , k2 can be bought for not to much money . then , the escrows . each of them will get 80 bit of a 160 bit key . security could as little as existant be maximized by giving them 160 bits each , which have to be xored together to give the k1 , k2 . now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy , and can not be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies . and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l . e . a which would hinder the l . e . a in doing their duties , and so on and so on once the keys are surrendered , the corresponding chip is compromised forever . not very clever , imho . how about sending in the encrypted session keys for each phone call that the police or whoever want's to listen to ? escrows could then simply decode this session key and send it back to police . and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired . this would be a better technical solution , but i guess politics will not work that way . apparently as miss dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi . great . so local guys can not inter cept understand your traffic anymore . does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? how is law over there , i have no idea who is allowed to tap , and who not this certainly means that watched communi cations will be routed automatically from the service providing company to the fbi , if the communicaiton is a watched one . and this means as far as i understand it that the family key has to be known by each switching company , and those providing cellular phone servies etcetc. so the family key will not be very secret , and thus serial numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares . i like traffic analysis ! what do you guess , what happens , if you use the chip in ecb mode , and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled ? so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line ? hmmm . shouldn not be so difficult to do that and now a last point , for the other side . after all i have read and heard about clipper not the programming language for dbase , is it ? it seems to have many advantages , which shold not be overseen ! now an afterthought to your rights . please note that i have no idea what i am talking about ! amendment 1  congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . if this text is actually in your bill of rights , who can overrule this ? but freedom of speech is not 'secrecy of speech maybe you need to extend your amendment 4 to cover information and communication too ? i am not very sure in what position your government actually is legally when it tries to ban cryptography and arms amendment say you may have them , but not under what conditions . hmm , tricky situation actually it will make not much sense to discuss that topic in sci . crypt . discussion of technical details and vulnerabilites of the system are highly suggested and appreciated friendly greetings , germano caronni disclaimer everything in here is derived from things i heard and read from other persons , so everything could be wrong . all opinions and thoughts in here are mine , and subject to change without further notification . no warranty , neither implicit not explicit etc. etc. etc. ad nauseam . ps please don not ask me about political opinions , as i might not bother to re ply . for further information read the last line of p . metzgers signature  instruments register only through things they are designed to register . space still contains infinite unknowns . pgp key id 341027 germano caronni fd560ccf586f3da747ea3c94dd01720f

5						 pompous ass look , i m not the one that made those nazi comparisons . other people compared what the religious people are doing now to nazi germany . they have said that it started out with little things but no one really knew about any of these little things , strangely enough and grew to bigger things . they said that the motto is but one of the little things you just contradicted yourself . the motto is one of those little things that nobody has bothered mentiopning to you , huh ? the little things above were in reference to germany , clearly . people said that there were similar things in germany , but no one could name any . they said that these were things that everyone should know , and that they weren not going to waste their time repeating them . sounds to me like no one knew , either . i looked in some books , but to no avail . that is going to pave the way for other intrusions . of course , if the motto hasn not caused problems in its 40 year history , then i doubt it is going to . it has caused problems. you just ignore every instance when someone describes one to you . it has caused problems ? again , no one has shown that things were better before the motto , or that they would likely be better after . i don not think the motto initiates any sort of harassment . harassment will occur whether or not the motto is present . keith

3			car	gun	circuit	catcher			 radar detector detectors ?  from what i understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car . they work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out . therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car .  unfortunately , you are wrong on both counts . the most common method of implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator . the local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great care . for a reference on detecting radios , get the paperback book spy catcher . the author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local oscillator emissions back in the 1950s while he worked for british intelligence . greg  greg andrews fortune cookie radioactive cats have 18 half lives .

2			technique			 zipper repairs was . tankbag . yep , it works like a charm . i had the same problem after about 7 8 years of constant use , and i was thinking of seeing how much eclipse would want to install a new zipper . but someone i think it was chuck karish suggested i try that trick . it took a couple of tries to get the right amount of squish , but it's been fine for about 3 years since i squished it . it should work for any of the nylon coil type zippers .  otoh i tried this on my hg concord jacket thursday night . really , i just made a tiny adjustment type of squeeze . really . is was ? your hg zipper the nylon coil type or the kind with molded plastic teeth ? i have only tried it on the coiled nylon type , and it doesn not take much squish to fix the problem . i found i was overdoing it no broken parts , but the zipper was too hard to pull so after spreading the zipper pull jaws again , i tried with vice grips . no , not the usual grip of death technique , i adjusted the closed vice grips so they were snug on the zipper jaws , then released them and tightened the adjusting screw a bit . a couple of iterations and i had just the right amount of zipper squish tm . result i now know that noplace in spokane will even consider trying to repair a broken zipper closer thingy , which must be a $ 0 . 30 part which needs a $ 20 tool to install . i have had two zipper pulls fail on my aerostich suit actually on the accessory ellipse , and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of charge . i don not know what brand of zippers hg uses , but parts are available for ykk's plastic zippers . replacement was pretty simple , just break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps the pull from coming off the top end . slide on the new zipper pull . then crimp on vice grips again ! a replacement zipper stop . you might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement parts . oh , for what it's worth , the coil type zippers on the eclipse tankbag are also ykk .  blaine gardner evans & sutherland

4			murder	war	firearm	citizen	liberty	target	weapon	population	dod	shooting	handgun	country	right	knife	crime	christian	assault	baseball	car	gun	defense	sport	violence	island			 my gun is like my american express card observations from a naive norwegian yup , you said it . i admire such honesty . 1 guns are made to kill people , not to shoot target or to have something more macho than stamps to collect . fire an anschutz . 22 , then come back and talk to us . you are letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking . either that , or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the olympic shooting events . funny , you would think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse . 2 it is more easy to kill injure someone with a gun than with a knife or a bat as in baseball . precisely . that makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry . not everybody has the time to train with a gladius , you know , but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time . to extend this a bit further , you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon . getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult , and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have . i have spent a few years practicing with a sword i can take the common person armed with one though self defense isn not the reason i own one . my kid sister would have an even chance of beating me , gun vs . gun , with only a month of training . that makes firearms much better , in our eyes . 3 it's not very wise to compare two completely different countries like usa and , let's say , island on issues like crime and violence . excellent point . perhaps you aren not so naive after all ? 4 yes , the problem is people committing crimes , not the tools beeing used , but 1 should be taken into concideration . taken into consideration in what respect ? though quite wrong , let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general . this has been taken into consideration . we call use of them aggrivated assault , assault with a deadly weapon , assault with intent to kill , attempted murder , and a whole host of others , and tack on extra prison time . we have a very strict gun legislation in norway , but until recently it was possible for enyone over 18 years to buy a shotgun . shotguns are used mainly for hunting in norway . but because it was so easy to accuire one , it was the most used gun in crimes . in norway i suspect it was about the only weapon available . you conquered your land among others a full millenia before we were thought of , and shortly thereafter weapons weren not quite so common . i suspect that a few world wars made a difference too , since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes . i m curious , though , were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime , or were they aquired by other means ? any requirements other than just registering the shotgun ? and unbelievable the use of guns in crime fell . there are now a new law against wearing long knives in public , and why should it be allowed ? come on down to honest erik's used swords ! here's a slightly used short sword , the battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century ! only $ 39 . 95 with trade in . easy financing ! sorry , i couldn not resist you guys still slicing each other with long knives , or is this really not a problem ? what i , as an scandinavian , have problems to understand is that you americans have a more liberal view on guns and violence than on nudity and sex . try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder . i m all for that . what gets me is that scandanavians and yes , i m only a couple generations off the longship used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago , yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing . maybe you had a bit more time , and a more homogeneous culture , to become civilized with ? yes , i know a little american history , but is it a civil human right to have an assault gun in your home and or an handgun in your car ? yes . we are too damned violent , partially i believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don not identify ourselves as americans first and foremost i m rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritage , whereas i suspect you couldn not care less about that 2 welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in ireland back in 1055 ? the time scale and the homogeneous culture are important . equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good . in america , the individual is more important than the masses . personal liberties are prized above all . this is , sadly , changing of late , but i trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to americans . i would hazard a guess that , were america less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere . one poor effect of this culture we have is that we are looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population . my grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in denmark because she spoke low dane , whereas others spoke high dane . it was shortly after world war ii , as i remember , that low dane was abolished so there was one common dialect . we cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem , because we have even more obvious means of identifying an outsider . the bad english is not my fault , it's probably the keyboard software or the quality of the subtext on tv . take heart , yours is better than 90 of what gets posted by native speakers . any helpful hints for our educational system ?

3			wing	truth	manufacturer	scheme	state	screen	utility	run			 how to the disks copy protected . backupable , if restored to the same machine depends on the programmer . don not use a disk drive characteristic ! if the user did an upgrade to the machine , he she should reinstall all programs any way . no document look up , no disk wear and tear ! this is not a good idea . i upgraded my motherboard last fall . i would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because i changed motherboards . opinion is understandable . i assume you have a tape drive ? not all of us have about 200 floppies around for backup , you know . any info in the bios is too volatile to use as a checksum . are you going to require that a user re install all their software if they add 4mb of ram to their computer ? i did that a couple of weeks ago . it's in the bios , and if software had told me this isn not the machine you installed me on i would never have used that software again . really bad idea . ram is something you add all the time , so no. it's more like bios manufacturer and or processor type 386 486 etc . data cannot be used , esp with these new flash rom bios machines with updates on a diskette . on the other hand , to make this less intrusive it could be disguised as please insert original disk xx as i need file yyyyyy for update . it would be perfectly reasonable . sort of . i did not say that the originals would allow only one install . the user's conscience should do that . this is silly . it's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk , and then give them that . your scheme isn not going to stop anyone . of course it is easier . are you saying then the originals should allow only one install ? what is your point ? you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz ? two ! yes , two ! and don not ask me which ones they are . do you know any assembly language at all ? all anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz , and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it . not that difficult , really ! and there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing . using pklite or some similar utility would help , but only if the resulting compressed . exe were tagged as uncompressable . i know x86 and 680x0 assembly quite well , thank you . i know exactly which two bytes need to be changed , i have the code to do them too . i just said don not ask me which ones . i didn not say i don not know what that means . such hacking can be easily discouraged by adding anti patching code which does a self check upon execution and refuse to load if crc does not match value stored encrypted , of course in the program . it could be claimed as a part of anti virus code , and it would not be far from the truth . what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup registered to xxxxx address , city , state zip and disables the above . this is by far the best idea you presented in your post making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates . but , the determined ones are just going to answer joe blow to the question of what's your name so this won not stop them in the long run . did anyone read what i wrote ? that is not what i wrote ! or meant ! what i said was the program should have certain restriction such as the restrict to one machine until the program is registered with the manufacturer . the manufacturer will then supply the then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the registered to xxx screen . pirates are always going to win this fight . they simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme . of course they will , but that was not my point . the purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates oh , can i have a copy of that ? sure , here . and the less sophisticated pirates let's look for all those calls to int13h . any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed . they can always backtrace the entire load sequence of the program . the point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses or to minimize such intrusion of legitimate use . pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them , and no amount of copy protection will stop them , but the rest of us will be stopped . how many of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us ? not that many . kasey chang

1			lane	price	link	windows	client	apps	server	file			 desqview x on a pc and network traffic  what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls ? i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running dv x is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time . anyone have any ideas ?  i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network itself . to give you a real world example , here at quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , novell file servers , and each other . it's not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe 4 concentrators , so you have 20 30 people on each segment . if you had a badly loaded net , or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive , you could run into some slowdowns .  but the biggest problem would be the machine itself . say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 10 people running programs off it , you are going to see some slowdowns because you are now on effectively a 3 . 3 mhz 486 . of course , dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice , but if you have 10 working programs running , you will know it .  well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year . the link i want to use though isdn 64k is costly and the bandwidth limited . that's why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic goes through it . having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth . hmmm . has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all ? are you running any standard ms windows programs like word ? what sort of packets go blazing through ? what size link do you have 2mb or 10mb ? what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points ? it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie . you are going to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also .  what do you mean by network things ? i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays . i am wondering how good is the x and subsequently dv x protocol in transferring these images with x calls and displaying them on a client's machine . quarterdeck office systems internet support tom bortels pricing ordering tech questions bbs 310 314 3227 fax 310 314 3217 compuserve go quarterdeck q fax 310 314 3214 from touch tone phone for technotes on demand !  george patapis pan metron ariston telecom c . s . s . c lane cove email pobox a792 sydney south fax 02 911 3 199 nsw , 2000 , australia . voice 02 911 3 121

5			atheist	being	mechanism	morality			 morality ? was re political atheists ? explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts , and i am happy to listen . for example , if it were instinctive not to murder . then not murdering would have no moral significance , since there would be nothing voluntary about it . see , there you go again , saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary . why do you think this ? and anyway , humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts . so , only intelligent beings can be moral , even if the bahavior of other beings mimics theirs ? you are starting to get the point . mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated . a parrot saying pretty polly isn not necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly . you are attaching too many things to the term moral , i think . let's try this is it good that animals of the same species don not kill each other . or , do you think this is right ? or do you think that animals are machines , and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong ? animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily , but they don not . they do . i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this , but you seem to have a very short memory . those weren not arbitrary killings . they were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot . are you trying to say that this isn not an act of morality because most animals aren not intelligent enough to think like we do ? i m saying there must be the possibility that the organism it's not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives . it's right there in the posting you are replying to . yes it was , but i still don not understand your distinctions . what do you mean by consider ? can a small child be moral ? how about a gorilla ? a dolphin ? a platypus ? where is the line drawn ? does the being need to be self aware ? what do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from arbitrarily killing each other ? don not you find the fact that they don not at all significant ? keith

5			violation	victim	morality	liberty	murder	reasoning	right	target	concept	punishment	atheist			 political atheists ? my turn to jump in ! reference line trimmed   .  there is a good deal more confusion here . you started off with the assertion that there was some objective morality , and as you admit here , you finished up with a recursive definition . murder is objectively immoral , but eactly what is murder and what is not itself requires an appeal to morality .  i think you mean circular , not recursive , but that is semantics . recursiveness has no problems , it is just horribly inefficient just ask any assembly programmer . yes .  now you have switch targets a little , but only a little . now you are asking what is the goal ? what do you mean by goal ? are you suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere , and we form our morals to achieve it ?  well , for example , the goal of natural morality is the survival and propogation of the species . another example of a moral system is presented within the declaration of independence , which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness . you see , to have a moral system , we must define the purpose of the system . that is , we shall be moral unto what end ? the oft quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is a complete lie and deception , as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving . liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , almost always at the cost to another . whos liberty is more inalienable ? similarly for right of life . when one person must die if he is to save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? that leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty , especially for serial killers . whos life and liberty is more valuable , the serial killer , or the victim ? according to that beautiful line , those two rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able to remove them . this includes government . admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and or liberty , but is not his own life liberty inviolate also ? according to the declaration of independence , it is . murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule . and , i thought i had defined murder as an intentional killing of a non murderer , against his will . oooh , i like that . it means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will . reason , an infant has no will as such . similarly for people who are brain dead easier to see , in a coma , etc. also , under current law , accidental killing is still murder . how will you include that ? and you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not . i fail to see what this has to do with anything . i never claimed that our system of morality was an objective one . i thought that was your very first claim . that there was some kind of objective morality , and that an example of that was that murder is wrong . if you don not want to claim that any more , that's fine . the only real golden rule in life is , he who has the gold , makes the rules . i.e. might makes right . that is survival . now what is wrong with that ? well , murder violates the golen rule , which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system . however , i am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral . i think that it is a very good approximation , but we can not be perfect . if you mean the golden rule as i stated , yes , almost every system as implemented has used that in reality . sorry , i don not deal as much in fiction , as i do in reality . and by the way , you don not seem to understand the difference between arbitrary and objective . if keith schneider defines murder to be this that and the other , that's arbitrary . jon livesey may still say well , according to my personal system of morality , all killing of humans against their will is murder , and wrong , and what the legal definition of murder may be in the usa , kuweit , saudi arabia , or the prc may be matters not a whit to me . welcome to ozland ! what is not arbitrary ? if you can find some part of society , some societal rules , morals , etc. that are not arbitrary , please tell me . i don not think there are any . well , objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts , while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning .  keith sounds like euphemisms to me . the difference seems to be , that objective is some reasoning that i like , while arbitrary is some reasoning that i don not like or don not understand . m 2
5			verse	priest	jesus	marriage	heaven	logic	bible	peter	los	god	church			 when are two people married in god's eyes ? y those with bibles on hand can give the exact chapter & verse . at the time jesus told peter that he was the rock , he said whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven , and whatever you don not hold true won not be true in heaven .  therefore , with respect to marriage , the ceremony has to be done by an rc priest no big parties required . just the priest , the couple and witnesses . divorce is not allowed . but anullments are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the pope not sure if the pope delegates this function .  maybe i m a little tired but i can not seem to follow the logic here . if whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest rc only apparently is required . in fact if i read the next verse correctly matthew 18 19 i understand that for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching one thing and it shall be done . todd   mark ashley disclaimer my opinions . not harris  the lost los angelino unfortunately i haven not been able to find any completely precise statements about what is needed . as usual , the current edition of the catholic encyclopedia is frustratingly vague . i do know that the priest is viewed as a witness , and thus in some sense would not be required . however part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment . the community provides support to marriage , and in cases of problems are involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of their commitment as possible . thus marriage must be a public commitment . the presence of a priest is required for a regular marriage . where i m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in exceptional cases valid but irregular . ne temere 1907 says that no marriage involving a catholic is valid without a priest according to the oxford dictionary of the church , and they imply that the new canon law retains this , but i would rather see a more recent and authoritative source . note that while a catholic priest is required for catholics , the catholic church does recognize marriage between baptized non catholics as valid without a priest clh

5			contradiction	concept			 ontology was benediktine metaphysics   if it is contradictory it cannot exist  contradictory is a property of language . if i correct this to   things defined by contradictory language do not exist   no need to correct it , it stands as it is said .    i will object to definitions as reality . if you then amend it to  things described by contradictory language do not exist  then we have come to something which is plainly false . failures in description are merely failures in description .   you miss the point entirely . things defined by contradictory language do not exist though something existing might be meant , conclusions drawn from the description are wrong , unless there is the possibility to find the described , and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of the described then . another possibility is to drop the contradictory part , but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well .  i m not an objectivist , remember .   neither am i . but either things are directly sensed which includes some form of modelling , by the way or they are used in modelling . using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of . wonder why ?  we remain with the question if something contradictory can be sensed as contradictory . an important point is that either one manages to resolve the contradictions or one is forced not to use or to refer to the contradictory part in drawing conclusions , or one will fall in the garbage in garbage out trap . benedikt

 mr. stephanopoulos that would be nice . let's go out to the cherry blossoms. we will do like the president .  q is the stimulus package dead ?  mr. stephanopoulos absolutely not .  q can you tell us more about the dole talks ? you said it was a good visit , but no compromise .  mr. stephanopoulos yes . the president had a good talk with senator dole last night . i think that as we said before , there were no specific compromises on either side , although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well . as you know , the president first called senator dole i believe tuesday night to talk about the russian aid package . they did not speak senator dole called him back wednesday morning when the president was out . instead he spoke with tony lake , and at the close of that conversation , indicated that he wanted to speak to the president about the jobs and stimulus package . they finally talked about that yesterday afternoon .  at the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night , which they did , when the senator was up in new hampshire . and although there were no specific compromises made on either side , they did say that they would continue to have some discussions . and that's where we are .  q well , who is giving in ? where is it standing are both making concessions ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know that it's at that phase . no compromise has been made . as the president has said consistently , he intends to come forward with an adjusted package . he believes in the package , but he believes that if it's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it , he's willing to make those adjustments .  q on the subject of a vat  mr. stephanopoulos oh , boy .  q can we stay on this for one more minute ?  mr. stephanopoulos sure .  q we have a problem with the five minutes  q i know no decisions have been made , but what would lead the health group to believe that a vat might be necessary ?  mr. stephanopoulos sorry , andrea , i m not going to go down that road . no decisions have been made . as the president said this morning , a number of groups , a number of members of congress , a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at . the working group is looking at it , but no decisions have been made .  q to follow , have they done that directly through him ? have labor and business groups been in touch with the president about it ?  mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge , although there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the vat . but the president has not made a decision .  q at the meetings that he's had with his own task force advisers , have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think that that has been presented for a decision , no.  q not for a decision , but has it been discussed as an option ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , there are a lot of levels of briefing . i do not believe that the vat has been presented to the president as , okay , this is something for you to decide on .  q you are not saying he didn not know it was being considered , though , are you ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , he said it's being considered .  q he knew that .  q but has he discussed that with his advisers ? that's what i m asking .  mr. stephanopoulos the president has said it's being considered . i do not know what level of discussion there has been over the vat . it is something the working groups are looking at . i don not even know that it's  q but he didn not say he was considering , did he , at this stage ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , he is not . i think we are getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here . what is considered  q well , he is the one who said , i haven not reviewed it .  mr. stephanopoulos that is true . that is what i just repeated .  q george , is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in february and the promise that if it were to be considered he would let us know , and having it trickle out the way it did , that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think so . i mean , it is now public knowledge that this is being considered .  q is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered , and then to have it come out not from you people , but  mr. stephanopoulos well , wait a second . it came out from the administration . what are you talking about ?  q what i m saying is , though , that the president said he would let us know .  mr. stephanopoulos right .  q you people then said you said , i believe , that it's not going to be on the program .  mr. stephanopoulos on march 25th .  q on march 25th .  mr. stephanopoulos circumstances change .  q well , i understand . but we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview  mr. stephanopoulos rooting around i know you did do a very good job there to read the usa today article . but this is laughter the deputy director of the omb and the secretary of health and human services . i mean , that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the clinton administration , the headline is i will look at it right here , and ap story clinton wants more money for spying .  q what about his remark that if it were being considered , he would tell us about it ?  mr. stephanopoulos and the administration's concerned , and he would let you know .  q and did he ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes . absolutely . what did he say this morning ?  q it had to be dragged out of you here yesterday .  mr. stephanopoulos it didn not have to be dragged out of me . we had the deputy director of the omb , we had the secretary of health of human services say it was being considered . that is his administration . that is his administration policy .  q were these authorized trial balloons , or were they orchestrated leaks ? i mean , what was the  mr. stephanopoulos they were asked questions , they answered the questions .  q you are saying here that it didn not have to be dragged out , that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it .  mr. stephanopoulos absolutely . i was very clear . painfully clear .  q was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , it was just this issue is being considered . they were asked if it was being considered ; they answered that it was being considered .  q george , the new york times  q why do it yesterday ?  mr. stephanopoulos they were asked .  q the new york times reports today that secretary reich and the chief economist at the labor department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the president's job stimulus bill , but which turned out to be totally false .  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if it was totally false , but i think laughter the chief economist at the labor department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing , and they say that .  q the question is , is the president concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data ? and what's he doing about it , if so ?  mr. stephanopoulos the chief economist has said that a mistake was made , it won not happen again , and that's the end of the matter .  q isn not that the same information that goes to the president ?  q if i could go back to the stimulus package  mr. stephanopoulos there's two separate pieces of information . i think that's where the confusion was .  q when did you all first learn about this mistake that was made ?  mr. stephanopoulos i read the article this morning .  q and as far as you know , is the president aware of it ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think so .  q and was he aware of it before he read about it in the new york times ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know . not to my knowledge .  q did you ever hear about it before this morning ? anything ?  mr. stephanopoulos i didn not .  q wasn not the president given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose ? for his speeches , for his arguments ?  mr. stephanopoulos well again , i m not sure . both statements are true . what the labor department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence , essentially , was misleading . they said it was a mistake . they said they wouldn not do it again .  q did they drop it is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of ?  mr. stephanopoulos whenever fewer people are out of work , we are gratified . but that doesn not take away from the need to get this jobs package going .  q if i could go back to the stimulus package for a minute . you said that the president plans to come forward with an amendment . is the timetable still what it was that the amendment would be laid down on monday and voted on on tuesday , or did he , in the conversation with dole , talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think at this point there's no changes in the schedule at all . i don not know that they discussed the timing like that .  q do you believe that you are closer or getting closer this week than you were last week ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , i believe that we are going to pass a jobs package . the president is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen . i don not know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time . i don not know what's going to happen until we have a vote . but the president believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done .  q has there been any indication that this situation has changed ?  mr. stephanopoulos we are going to continue to work on it . we will know when the votes are taken .  q george , last week you said that there are or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn not go through dole , you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise , or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept . this week you are talking to him . is that because you have realized that the peeling off effort wasn not going to work ?  mr. stephanopoulos that's because senator dole wanted to talk to the president about the stimulus package .  q he initiated the conversation ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q secretary reich this morning said that , in fact , the president is not willing to compromise on this bill at all . you say he's making  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know that that's exactly what he said . i think he said he didn not have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise , and the president doesn not want to compromise . and the president doesn not want to compromise . but if he has to make adjustments to get it through , he will .  q officials here yesterday said that panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote .  mr. stephanopoulos it's possible .  q today ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not sure exactly when that will happen , but i think that it's very possible that we will come forward with some sort of a different package , or senate democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed .  q as we understood his conversations with dole , the first one was some discussion of this and i will get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments , or whatever the phrase is . did he offer him some details or some adjustments ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think it's a question of how detailed . i mean , i think they had a general discussion about the package last night , subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon . i believe that there will be follow up discussions today in the senate , not necessarily between the president and senator dole . and let me just reiterate , neither side has made specific compromises at this date . when we have something we will let you know . and i m not suggesting that senator dole has accepted anything that we have talked about or that we have offered anything in a hard way .  q what are the follow up discussions if not the president and dole ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think senator mitchell is going to talk to senator dole .  q is that a threat ? laughter .  q did the president say to senator dole , all right , how about this number as an overall size , or did dole say to the president , i can go as high as this ? did they talk numbers ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think it was a negotiation in that respect . it was more of a discussion about their positions .  q did they discuss actual numbers ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m just not sure . i know they about the programs they cared about . i don not know if they got to the level of this many x billion dollars .  q does dole have to sign off before there is a package ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , of course not .  q did the white house have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in new hampshire today where senator dole was speaking ? was that in any way organized by  mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge , no.  q and has the president been in touch with senators kohl or feingold ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think he's talked to them , no.  q george , is the president considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have nots ? and is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few , with the haves having to pay for the have nots ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income americans , as he presented in his budget , should go up . and i think for the second half of your question , i will refer you to my briefing from yesterday .  q george , on the subject of accuracy in information , you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in milwaukee . apparently that is not true . it's actually waste water money .  mr. stephanopoulos it's waste water money for wisconsin , and some could go to milwaukee .  q but it would not affect the drinking water problem because it's waste water money , right ?  mr. stephanopoulos it would affect the water treatment overall .  q but the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in milwaukee now . would you agree that's not the case ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not sure of the specifics . i know that it goes to the overall water treatment in wisconsin .  q a leftover question from this morning , which was , when did the president find out that the task force was deliberating on a vat ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not sure exactly when . i just don not know . i assume it came up over the last certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago .  q so sometime since march 25th ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think that's right . i don not know the exact date .  q george , the president this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the vat tax . apparently , the national association of manufacturers talks about perhaps the vat tax being okay if it replaces the btu tax . so does the president feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed , or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already proposed ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think we have said all we have to say about the vat at this point . i mean , there's just no this is being considered by the health care working groups , and that is all . the president hasn not made any further decisions beyond that .  q but it would be to finance health care , it wouldn not be to replace some other tax that finances it wouldn not replace the income tax , for instance ?  mr. stephanopoulos there have been no discussions on that .  q in terms of getting a vat tax through congress , senator dole's press release today said vat on tax day . do you think does it have a chance of getting through congress ? would it have a chance ?  mr. stephanopoulos i have no idea .  q is that a consideration whether you all put it forward ?  mr. stephanopoulos that would become a consideration if the president were to decide to do it . it's not in consideration now .  q you said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the vat to now be under consideration .  mr. stephanopoulos yes , what the president referred to this morning . these groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered .  q those are the circumstances that have changed ? that's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered ?  mr. stephanopoulos that's what he said .  q is that true ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q was there , in fact , some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m not going to get into the deliberations .  q but , george  mr. stephanopoulos no. what the consideration is , as the president said , groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider . the working groups are looking at it .  q is that the only thing that's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the vat ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q can you explain how those groups how that information got to him that groups wanted it ? was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think the groups as you know , the health care task force has met with dozens of groups .  q but this is the president's knowledge that these groups had come forward  mr. stephanopoulos i think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups . obviously , there have also been published positions in the newspapers .  q have certain groups briefed him on the group's presentations to them ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if they have briefed him i mean , how detailed the briefings have been . i know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups .  q what kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the president would change the position that he had enunciated previously ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know , it's just they have had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care .  q the president wasn not aware of those longstanding positions ?  mr. stephanopoulos he may have been at some level . obviously , he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a vat tax .  q what we are trying to figure out here you are telling us that the only change , the only thing that affected this change in the president's attitude toward the vat between february and now  mr. stephanopoulos the president's attitude hasn not necessarily changed . i mean , he has not made a decision .  q i know , but the president said that it was off the table . so did you . and you are saying that the only thing that's changed is the positions of these groups , except you are also describing them as longstanding positions . i don not see the change . if these groups haven not had any change in their position that's been made to the president  mr. stephanopoulos well , they have made the presentations to the health care task force .  q there's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said suggested in february that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue .  q well , he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care .  mr. stephanopoulos he did say that . i don not know that he said anything to refute that .  q but , in fact , has the task force discovered that there wouldn not be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits  mr. stephanopoulos again , i don not think that the task force ever suggested that there would .  q george , if he advocated a vat tax , would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs ?  mr. stephanopoulos i can not comment on a hypothetical situation .  q but does that promise would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a vat tax ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president has made no decisions on the vat tax . when he does , we will tell you and we will explain the implications then .  q which specific groups can you cite business , labor or otherwise whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not have the specific . i just don not have that .  q george , can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives , for instance , the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said , they are looking at a wide variety of options . i think that ira magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration . but i m not going to comment  q what's the scope  mr. stephanopoulos i m just not going to comment on them , no.  q what's the scope of the need ? how much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the   mr. stephanopoulos that's what the health care task force is looking at .  q since there's not going to be any briefing on the miyazawa visit , two questions one , generally what does the president hope to use that meeting for , but more specifically , is his task complicated by the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference ?  mr. stephanopoulos the vancouver note ?  q does no mean yes .  q yes and no.  mr. stephanopoulos well , i don not know . i saw the prime minister's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question . the questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the prime minister and the president . there is obviously a trade imbalance between japan and the u.s. that we want to do something about .  q also in those comments the prime minister made he suggested that the united states should come down heavy on him in terms of trade . are you going to oblige ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think the president will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly . i don not necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the prime minister's comments .  q that we need specific export targets , specific numerical targets is that what he's going to discuss with miyazawa ?  mr. stephanopoulos they are going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues . i don not want to get into those specifics until after the meeting .  q why ?  q that's the crux of the issue , right ? whether or not does the president believe that without specific numerical targets , it is really , as he said in his press conference , sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president believes that we must have pressure on japan to turn the trade imbalance around . i do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done .  q but does the president believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think , first , the president wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from prime minister miyazawa himself , and then he will make the comment on it .  q how about the russian aid package ? there seems to be some confusion about how the u.s. views that , secretary christopher saying or bentsen saying the japanese may need to do more , the japanese saying that that's not what they heard ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , we are going to continue to work with all our allies in the g 7 , and we are going to continue to press for help for russian reform , russian democratic reform . and i think that , so far , we had a very good announcement out of tokyo and we are going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages .  q do you think the japanese need to do more ?  mr. stephanopoulos we are going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can .  q secretary christopher was asked today on the today show this morning what he thought of margaret thatcher's comments on the bosnia policy . and he said , it's a rather emotional response . mr. stephanopoulos over an emotional issue .  q right to an emotional problem . does the white house condone that kind of remark ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think that secretary christopher's remarks speaks for itself . the president believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we are trying to find answers for .  q but that specific rather emotional response specific term ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , it speaks for itself .  q in connection with that , doesn not it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment , is it good american policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help boris yeltsin win a referendum ?  mr. stephanopoulos for example ?  q to take stronger action , to take military action air strikes , anything that can be done ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions . he is also as you know , the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo . he believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time .  q what is your response to the critics who would say that the u.s. is now stymied by trying to help boris yeltsin retain the presidency ?  mr. stephanopoulos they are wrong . we are pressing hard for the serbs to come to the negotiating table . we are pressing hard for increased sanctions , and we are talking to our allies about the arms embargo .  q you were putting great store in vance and owen getting people to agree to that . now , vance and owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable . does that change your thinking ?  mr. stephanopoulos clearly , we are going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say . but at this point , the president is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo .  q a follow up on a dee dee comment this morning . she said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in bosnia . are you going to be able to do that , or do you have anything  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think that's what she said .  q that's exactly what she said .  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think that's true . but what she said we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in bosnia . obviously , if there are connections between the bosnian serbs and the serbs in belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the serbs in belgrade , that will have an effect over time . i do not know day by day , minute by minute , what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been . but , clearly , we are slowing the shipment of goods into belgrade . we are having an effect on the serbs there . what kind of effect that will eventually have on the bosnian serbs i don not know . but one thing i would say is if it were having no effect at all , i don not know why they would be fighting it so much .  q are the first lady's tax returns going to be released ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think there's a joint tax return . and it will be probably later today .  q is the president considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think there's any proposal for that at this time , not that i know of .  q it's something that the president promised during the campaign that he would do .  mr. stephanopoulos i have not seen any i don not think it's anything that's on his plate right now .  q is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know about on this issue . i assume that he will meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon , as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities .  q do you know if that's scheduled  mr. stephanopoulos it's probably going to be tomorrow .  q probably going to be tomorrow ? laughter .  q it's a good thing you asked .  q who's probably going to be there ? laughter .  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know .  q how long  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know . that's all i know .  q do you know if it's at 3 00 pm tomorrow ? laughter .  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know what time it is . i don not even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow .  q environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind . is that going to happen , do you know ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if they have asked , but i think the president has always planned , as he did last year , to give a speech on earth day and i expect that he will . if it's not exactly on earth day , it might be a day before or something like that .  q is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with earth day ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , i don not know the specific timing of something like that , but it's certainly something under discussion and something we have been working on .  q campaign finance reform ?  mr. stephanopoulos we are working on it .  q do you think it will be next week ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m just not sure .  q the biodiversity treaty is something you are working on ? i missed the question .  mr. stephanopoulos yes , something we are working on . he asked if it was ready to be signed , and i said i didn not know anything about that but it's something we have certainly been working on .  q do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not .  q do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march ?  mr. stephanopoulos he's got to be at the senate meeting in jamestown , and i believe he's also going to be giving a speech to the american association of newspaper publishers in boston on sunday , as he did last year .  q would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question ?  mr. stephanopoulos on what ?  q on the gays .  mr. stephanopoulos when we went through the president's schedule for the day , certainly .  q ? george , what day is the publisher's speech ? is that sunday ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think it's a sunday .  q and saturday he will be in jamestown ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q so you are just going to be in jamestown for one day ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , i m not sure . i don not know how long the senate thing goes . it might go overnight . i just don not know .  q you would have made the gay meeting public , right ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m certain if we had the meeting i don not know about open to the press , but we would have told you about it .  q i mean , because it is , as far as i can tell , the first time in history a president has met in the oval office with mr. stephanopoulos i didn not say it was going to be in the oval office . laughter . but i didn not i m not say that it's not , but i didn not say that it was . laughter .  q at the white house in the bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the white house had to repudiate having done that . so i just wanted to make sure  mr. stephanopoulos well , the president wouldn not do anything like that .  q certainly not .  q what marching orders did the president give to general vessey ?  mr. stephanopoulos they had a very good discussion for about half an hour today . he wanted the most important thing was he had a full accounting for american pows and mias . he will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document . the president stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards vietnam . he will be looking at vietnam's response to the questions raised by the document and he will also look into investigations on discrepancy cases , increased efforts on remains , implementing trilateral investigations and access to military archives .  and ambassador toon also briefed the president on the activities of the joint commission and on the document .  q vietnam says it's a fake . what is the dod analysis at this stage ?  mr. stephanopoulos it's not completed yet , and it's also the first thing that general vessey will bring up with the vietnamese .  q a number of defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are , in fact , non americans that the vietnamese had captured who they referred to as americans from time to time . do people  mr. stephanopoulos we don not have any final determination . we are going to wait for the complete review ; when we have it , we will make a judgment .  q i know you don not have any final determination , but given all of the intense public interest in this , do you think that that's a likely possibility ?  mr. stephanopoulos i just don not want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete .  q george , was there a topic scheduled for the speech in boston ?  mr. stephanopoulos no.  q is the president going to have a press conference tomorrow with miyazawa ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think so , but i m not positive . yes , i expect , yes .  q was toon in with vessey ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q he was in on the meeting ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q what was the question ?  mr. stephanopoulos was ambassador toon in with vessey , and the answer is yes .  q do you have any response to the wall street journal report this morning the president's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that ?  mr. stephanopoulos no. well , i do have a response . i think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the president has had restricted access to the press . i would point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions , more than any of his predecessors . i would also point out it also  q how many questions ?  mr. stephanopoulos three hundred fifty eight , on 77 occasions .  q how many were while he was jogging ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , no , that's actually a very good question , andrea . and i would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities , which is just patently false . he's had 13 press conferences in either the east room , the oval office or the roosevelt room or the briefing room , in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities , and that is only the  q oval office press conference when was that ?  mr. stephanopoulos he's answered questions in the east room . he's had five in the east room , he's had one in the oval office , he's had one in the rose garden , he's had one or two in the roosevelt room . and this is just to the white house , washington press corps . in addition to that , he's had 17 interviews with local television anchors . he's met with the editorial board of the portland oregonian . he's had an hour long interview with dan rather . he's had interviews with local press from california , florida and connecticut  q can you address the question of the attitude ? the article implies that he doesn not  q why doesn not he like us ? laughter .  q did you really get blamed for that post story ?  q the story is that you are you held responsible for it .  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think i m going to comment about this .  q are you denying that the president has shown displeasure publicly ?  mr. stephanopoulos i am not commenting on the discussions between the president and myself .  q did the president write that letter to chris webber ?  mr. stephanopoulos what ?  q the letter to the university of michigan basketball player ?  mr. stephanopoulos oh , yes .  q that is an authentic letter ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q since the president first talked about the vat in february , he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing . does he still hold that position given the impact it could have ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , i just can not comment on a proposal he hasn not made .  q george , does the president have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , i think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including aids and other issues civil rights .  q the military issue ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m certain it will come up .  q is he using this event to name the aids  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think so .  q george , what specifically is the president doing to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the prime minister miyazawa ?  mr. stephanopoulos he's had briefing memos . he's had general discussions with members of the treasury department , the trade representative and others .  q report yet ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if he has the report referred to in the times , but ambassador kantor was here to brief him today .  q he was ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q does he intend to use any of these instances that   mr. stephanopoulos again , i don not know that the report's been presented . but obviously , the president will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred .  q in terms of the wall street journal , the thrust was that there's a real schism here a hostility . do you think he feels that way ?  mr. stephanopoulos not at all . as i said on the record in the article , i think the president likes reporters . again , i think that the thrust of the article was still misleading . the thrust of the article was that in some way , some attitude which the president may or may not have is affecting access when , in fact , he has the most open , accessible administration than have any in recent history . q can we come up to your office ? laughter . mr. stephanopoulos if you are invited .  the press thank you . end 1 34 pm edt  57 04 15

2			pitching	incident	game	league	season	espn			 game length was re braves update ! stuff about ron gant incident deleted a reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of games . i for one am glad to see this happen , i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that gant should have listened to him . however , what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games . you are the first person non mediot i have seen endorse this policy . i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd and other announcers bitching about it . i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a ticket , i don not mind a game that last more than 2 10 . i really don not understand it . games are longer now for several reasons more pitching changes , more basestealing and throws to first , etc . i think a very small factor is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batter's box . my impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games they get to head back to hotel bar , eat steaks , get drunk , tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar . sure they want the game over with . print journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games constantly harp on this primarily because they often have to work late when the game goes longer than 2 30 . maybe i am just a ne er do well with nothing better to do , but i would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you . as a parenthetical note , it seems the league is in any case fighting a losing battle this year . the increased offense thus far will certainly spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly . nick flynn

1			algorithm	incident			 raytracing colours ? illumination equations when an incident ray i strikes an object at point p . the reflected ray r and the transmitted ray t is calculated from the formulae .  calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours along the rays r and t as rcol and tcol . each object has its own colour ocol and each light source has licol 1 i n .  the question is how do you combine rcol , tcol , ocol and all the licol's to get the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray ? first of all this is not a snide response , if you are confused about this issue , you will stumble over a lot of other things as well . i suggest that the weakness is your reference material . get an introduction to ray tracing by andrew glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm . you could also refer to the 2nd edition of foley & van dam . on to the question . the simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity . for example , if your intensity values range from 0 . 0 to 1 . 0 , then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1 . 0 you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0 . 0 if you have dark bulbs , but that's another issue . so , you get some illumination equation like this i lambient ldiffuse light n lreflected ltransparent the contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity , as is the light due to transparency . now , a slightly less hand waving illumination equation is this i kala kdld light n krlr ktlt that is , each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants ka , kd , kr and kt . so the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object , for example , might be 0 . 4 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 for a purple colored glass object . hopefully this answers your question . i will forward my illumination equation sermon to you also .  steve hollasch kubota pacific computer , incorporation santa clara , california

3			patient	bank	manufacturer			 should patients read package inserts pdr ? hmmmm . here's one place where i really think the patient ought to take more responsibility for him or herself . there is absolutely no reason why you can not ask the pharmacist filling the prescription for the physicians package insert for the medication when you pick it up at the pharmacy . make sure to tell the pharmacist that you want the physicians package insert not the if people are going to do this , i really wish they would tell me first i would be happy to go over the insert in the pdr with them and explain everything . all too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one . some of them probably didn not even come back for followup because they didn not want to admit they wouldn not take the drug or thought i was trying to kill them or something . what people don not understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported , without substantiating that the drug was responsible . the insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen . if patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the ama drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific . there are very few drugs that someone hasn not reported a death from taking . patients don not realize that and don not usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly . i m sure herman is going to go ballistic , but so be it . another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence . half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that . this can be a real problem for pdr readers . there needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need . i am involved in a research project to do that , with migraine as the domain . it involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient . for common illnesses , such as migraine and hypertension , this may help quite a bit . the patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician . clearly , physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have , as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn not . why they didn not isn not always the physician's fault either . sometimes the patients are afraid to ask . they won not be as afraid to ask the system , we hope .   gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect , and it is shameful to surrender it too soon .

2			run	notion	player	war			 geronimo pena ?   hey . i have noticed that luis alicea is starting at 2nd for the cardinals instead of geronimo pena . is pena hurt , or was he just benched for poor performance ? anyone know ?  after a quick start , pena has been stuck in a rut . torre gave alicea the start to try to get pena out of whatever funk he is in . it has worked in the past   and it has worked again . pena went 3 for 3 last night against colorado .  without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war , i would like to question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real effect on his long term performance . sure , if a man is tired and needs real rest , then taking a break might be a constructive act . perhaps if a man is mentally strained , then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax . but i would like to suggest that in the long run , players do slump , and benching is probably irrelevant . paul collacchi

5			love	christian	christ	prayer	god	sinner	teaching	enemy	neighbor	sin			 hate the sin . hate begets more hate , never love . consider some sin . i will leave it unnamed since i don not want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin . now lets apply our hate the sin . philosophy and see what happens . if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the stronger our hatred of it will become . eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner . though you can certaily assert all this , i don not see why it necessarily has to be the case . why can not hate just stay as it is , and not beget more ? who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner . i admit this happens , but i donlt think you can say it is always necessaily so . why can we not hate with a perfect hatred ? in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors . he doesn not say anything about hate . in fact , if anything , he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves . so , how are christians supposed to deal with the sin of others ? i suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin either in others or ourselves . through prayer . we certainly we should love even our enemies . amos 5 15 says to hate the evil and love the good . this can not contradict christ's teaching . i think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude , when it really should be considered more objectively . surely i don not fly into a rage at every sin i see , but why can i not hate it ? paul duggan

5			truth	belief	judgement	content	nature	fallacy	morality			 after 2000 years , can we say that christian morality is reply to frank o would wyer  i m one of those people who does not know what the word objective means when put next to the word morality . i assume its an idiom and cannot be defined by its separate terms.  give it a try .  objective morality is morality built from objective values .  from a dictionary of philosophy , by anthony flew  objectivism the belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired . for instance , no one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be thought of as a plausible example . even in a world of sadists who all rejected it , the contention remains true , just as 5 7 12 remains correct even if there is no one left to count . the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established . if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world . nor can they be analytic , since this would involve lack of action guiding content ; one ought always to do the right thing is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic . at this point the objectivist may talk of 'self evident truths , but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder ? if not , what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true ? the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself . to hold a moral opinion is , he suggests , not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity .  david nye . midelfort clinic , eau claire wi this is patently absurd ; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities . bertrand russell

5			notion	belief	morality	punishment	hitler	right	minority			 societal basis for morality you asked me to look over here , but i was on my way back anyway reply to mike cobb  if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that ? what right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality ? pardon the extremism , but couldn not i murder your brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was doing what felt good , didn not want anyone forcing their morality on me , or i don not follow your morality ?  i believe that morality is subjective . each person is entitled to his own moral attitudes . mine are not a priori more correct than someone elses . this does not mean however that i must judge another on the basis of his rather than my moral standards . while he is entitled to believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is offensive to the majority . why ? your last statement . why ? by which authority ? most criminals do not see their behavior as moral . the may realize that it is immoral and not care . they are thus not following their own moral system but being immoral . for someone to lay claim to an alternative moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be internally consistent . why ? your last statement . why are these things necessary ? and believe me , a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly consistent . some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and thus may be incapable of behaving morally . while someone like hitler may have believed that his actions were moral , we may judge him immoral by our standards . holding that morality is subjective does not mean that we must excuse the murderer . trouble is , this would sound just fine coming from someone like hitler , too . i do not mean any comparison or offence , david . try substituting the social minority of your choice for 'sociopath , hitler , and murderer . no logical difference . someone like you , vs . someone like hitler . zero sum .  frank o would wyer i m not hatching that from hens , by evelyn conlon

2			sox	jay	cheer	pitcher	morris			 jack morris  i don not think it was that obvious at the time that viola was better . morris and viola had comparable k ip ratios in 1991 . viola was coming off an injury , whereas morris was healthy . at the time i didn not really want the sox to sign either . i was more than a little worried about viola's elbow . but you surely remember my shout of relief when , after a week of rumors that morris was coming to the red sox , they ended up with viola instead . now i m even happier . viola seems to have rebounded nicely . also , morris was willing to sign for only two years . the jays don not like to sign pitchers to long term contracts , which i think is a sensible policy . how long did viola sign for . three years ? i generally agree with their policy of avoiding long term contracts for pitchers . but i think they enforce it rather too strictly . these days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals . which leaves the jays with morris and stewart . if the jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers , they will have to accept greater risks . any idea what the option year deal is for morris ? are there any automatic activation clauses ? what is the buyout amount ? f cheers , valentine

5			believer	truth	notion	christian	testament	jesus	atheist	figure	gospel	officer			 history & texts was ancient references to christianity in response to mike cobb .  why is the nt tossed out as info on jesus . i realize it is normally tossed out because it contains miracles , but what are the other reasons ? far from being tossed out , the gospels are taken , almost universally , as the primary source of information about jesus . i am curious as to whom mike cobb is referring . who tosses out the new testament ? undoubtedly a few naive atheists do this , but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that cobb ascribes this more broadly . perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why , except for some naive believers who , unfortunately , far outnumber nonbelievers , both naive and critical , are the gospels not taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago ? this has an easy answer , and the answer has nothing to do with miracles no text is taken this way by a critical reader . there is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text , measures it by some set of criteria , and then either confirms the text as historically valid or tosses out the text . i suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school , where certain texts are vested with authority , and from writers such as josh mcdowell who pretend to present program . in fact , most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out , even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above , and josh mcdowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice . and their use in studying history . first , all texts are historically valid . all texts . or to put this another way , i have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any sense when applied to a text . second , no text should be read as telling the gospel truth about historical events , in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school . no text . this includes your favorite author's history of whatever . every text is a historical fact . every text was written by some person or some group of people for some purpose . hence , every text can serve as historical evidence . the question is what can we learn from a text ? of what interesting things if any does the text provide evidence ? the diaries of the followers of the maharishi , formerly of oregon , are historical evidence . the gospels are historical evidence . the letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in eastern europe are historical evidence . the modern american history textbooks that whitewash great american figures are historical evidence . these are all historical evidence of various things . they are not much evidence at all that the maharishi , formerly of oregon , could levitate ; that jesus was resurrected ; that vampires exist ; or that great american figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in school . they are better evidence that some people saw the maharishi , late of oregon , levitate ; that some of the early christians thought jesus was resurrected ; that many people in eastern europe saw vampires return from the grave ; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history . how does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence text or otherwise evinces ? this is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer . there are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject . i enjoy david hackett fischer's historian's fallacies as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history . it's relatively cheap . it's easy to read . give it a try . russell

4			state	police	defense	citizen	constitution	atf	assault	building	right	officer	communication			 welcome to police state usa critisism is too easy . what solutions do people have that would have been better than what the fbi had been doing for the last few months ?  firstly , they could have backed off .  regardless of who was at fault in the first assault the one in which four atf officers died , once that was over backing off was no longer an option . the people inside , particularly koresh , were criminal suspects . they could have made a case of self defense , if they wanted , in a court of law . until then the police had the responsibility to capture and arrest them . i have never heard of a case where the police knew there was a criminal suspect in a building , and still decided to back off . continuing the siege was one of the few alternatives to what actually took place , and it's a matter of debate whether any of these would have ended any better .  how about letting in the press ? how about letting koresh out to talk to the press ? maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the press tv for a couple of days he would have surrendered peacefully . how about letting the relatives of koresh s followers talk ? seems to me when you isolate someone , try to send them crazy by playing loudspeakers through the night of tibetan chants , etc . you don t have much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy . i m not too sure of their sanity to start with . i am very suspicious when the government controls all communication , and sends the press 2 miles away . i have a gut feeling that no knock warrant , which is sealed , would not stand up to scrutiny . i don t think no knock warrants are what the constitution writers had in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure . i don t think an all powerful central , high taxing government was what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights to the citizens and states and restricted central government .

4			session	incident	church	nature	sport			 x newsposter tmail version 1 . 20r israeli destruction of mosque s in jerusalem  this issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of just one reference probably won not resolve this issue to those that oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed . even in your location of this one reference , you spend most of your quote dealing with an incidence that , while abhorrant , has nothing to do with the issue at hand here . then , at the end of the quote , there is an almost off hand comment that two mosques were destroyed .  to support a claim of this nature , what other authors support this incident ? if identifiable mosques were destroyed they are certainly identifiable , they have names and addresses steet location . the comment by one reporter does make us wonder if this happened but by no means proves it .  there is no doubt that israeli authorities ordered the destruction of mosques in the vicinity of the wailing wall . that does not mean , however , that once can generalize from this to any other points . the entire plaza , mosques and all , was cleared to make it possible for jews to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of them , and which had been denied to them for millenia .  on the other hand , throughout the rest of jerusalem and israel , to the best of my knowledge , israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided damage to any islamic religious sites . this contrasts with the policies of previous regimes which destroyed jewish synagogues out of hate and bigotry . or , for that matter , with the usa . around here , nobody reroutes freeways to avoid churches , synagogues , and so forth . they just get condemned , paid off , and the road goes through . the same is standard policy for any number of other public projects schools and sports arenas being only two examples . anticipating the objection that the cases aren not comparable how not ? the wall has to count as the 1 tourist attraction in that part of the world ; making room for the traffic would be a twenty second decision for any city council i ever heard of . d . c . sessions speaking for myself note new network address author and everything else ! of tmail dos mail news shell

4			industry	neighbor	amendment	price	doctrine	victim	tie	violation	hundred	agreement	regulation	arm	state	understanding	right	sale	advance			 law and economics i m going to be mixing together here stuff from two of ted frank's articles , which was a response to me and a response to tim smith . yes , i know , the boomer court didn not call it eminent domain . but if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain . wdstarr  are all tort cases really eminent domain cases then ? what about bankruptcy ? contract ? eminent domain is a state mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party , regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all , at a price which is set by the state . i fail to see how this doctrine can be found in tort , bankruptcy or contract cases in general . well , okay , sort of in bankruptcy .  if so , so what ? since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties ? wdstarr  since you said that boomer 's reliance on economics led to an unjust result . i m pointing out that your alternative is far more unjust , in the traditional sense of the world .  atlantic cement's act was not wrongful . it did something that we as a capitalistic society should want them to do build a factory , create industry and jobs . the cost of compliance was grossly disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs . bang . here's one of the places where we widely diverge . you believe that the courts , in deciding a civil dispute between two parties , should consider as a factor perhaps as an overriding factor issues which i believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute . boomer v . atlantic cement co . was an action brought by one party , boomer , whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party , the atlantic cement company . the facts supported boomer's contention that atlantic cement was wrongfully damaging his property , and boomer asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop doing so . end of story . there was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want atlantic cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs . those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court . bill , if the government had stepped in and the epa made a regulation requiring multi million dollar cement plants to be shut down because of a smattering of cement dust , at a cost benefit ratio of 15 1 , you would be up in arms. why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way , but not the legislative or executive branches ? i would be up in arms ? why do you assume that ? quite the contrary , i would probably support the action , since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that i believe would have been correct in boomer the idea that people's property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency . in boomer it was boomer's property rights which i believe the court should have protected ; in the hypothetical epa ruling you have presented , it's the american people's collective property rights in a healthy physical environment . what good is cost benefit ratio of 15 1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air ?  your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant . if the state of massachusetts came up with a similar regulation , you would be up in arms and complaining about interference with property rights , and fifth amendment violations . once again why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way , but not the legislative or executive branches ? or are you not the libertarian you present yourself as being ? ted frank  how would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant ? wouldn not it just mean that when buying land for a cement plant , you would have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would stay on your land , or buy pollution easements from the surrounding landowners ? tim smith  all it takes is one holdout out of hundreds of neighbors to scrap the plant . furthermore , each of the neighbors is going to want the full benefit of the bargain under the resulting bilateral monopoly . a bonanza for lawyers , to be sure , who get to negotiate each of these agreements , a windfall for homeowners who can extort away any profits the plant would make , but not particularly good for society . yes . so what ? the courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals , not the general interests of some nebulous society . if society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights , fine . otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant . see , ted , i really am a libertarian after all ! that's the whole point behind the coase theorem . in a world without transactions costs , the land will automatically be put to the best use , as it is transferred from person to person instantaneously without friction ; the legal regime will not matter , because the result will be the same . in a world such as ours , one with transactions costs , one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with , in order to minimize the transactions costs . one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with , in order to minimize the transactions costs . which one are you speaking of ? i want the legal regime to protect people's rights . besides , coase's theorem only has real application in the never never land of perfectly rational actors . in the real world 1 some people are going to be stubborn , ornery , spiteful or otherwise irrational from a economic point of view and 2 the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so . i don not care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $ 100 of damage to my property per head , so i should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for , say , $ 150 per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain don not want any damned cattle on my property , not at any price .  and then you say everyone's property rights were protected ; the plaintiffs were made whole ; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided . as above , i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole . they were , in fact , by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them . wdstarr  then , by your argument , no tort plaintiff is ever made whole , because the award of damages in involuntary . why should we treat a nuisance plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff ? we don not require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation ; why in tort ? last question first for the same reason as in contract law because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the thirteenth amendment . as to your then , by your argument , no tort plaintiff is ever made whole , because the award of damages in involuntary claim , you are at least partially right . faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone , courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer . in these cases , the sale has already taken place and is irreversible , and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid , under the doctrines that a only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and b even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood . both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere , but neither is relevant to cases like boomer in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and can be reversed undone i.e . prevented from happening at all by order of the court . in these types of cases , all the court has to do is require that the potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually acceptable price . there is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding . it can leave that operation up to the parties themselves . and again i ask since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided ? if so , i have been miseducated i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done .  unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive . in cases like boomer , they are simply a cost of doing business . the fact that the proprietors of the atlantic cement co . got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without first trying to negotiate with boomer and everyone else whose property rights they would be violating via the operation of their plant . there's nothing punitive or unjust about it . 2 it is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act , and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear , should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement's wrongful acts . wdstarr  anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire set of possessions to wronged person ? weren not you complaining about excess punitive damages before ? anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim , in advance . and the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege . no injustice , no punitive damages .  you would like posner , bill . he's a libertarian .  really ? i didn not know that . what , if anything , has he had to say about cases like boomer ? wdstarr  in eal , he cites it as an example of bilateral monopoly that the court correctly avoided . i m sure its covered in the landes and posner book on tort law , presumably favorably , but i don not have that book in front of me . doesn not sound very much like a libertarian to me . libertarians tend to believe in the rights of individual people , not societies .  i have admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as law and economics is weak . if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many tie breaker factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute , as measured by the scale of justice , is evenly balanced , fine . but as illustrated by boomer , it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case . wdstarr  in this case the justice of the case was intricately tied up with the economics of the case . atlantic cement committed a tort causing $ 185k of damage . should it pay in the millions ? or just compensate for the damage it committed ? as stated above , the tort was ongoing . atlantic cement wanted to be able to continue to violate boomer's rights . while the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed , it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the future violations of boomer's rights and to then force boomer to sell at that price . william december starr

2			player	explanation	game	coach	islander	management	team			 mogilny must be benched . anyway , this game continued a trend that has sadly been taking shape for a couple of weeks now . i had hoped it was fatigue , or an aberration , but i can not snow myself any longer . alex mogilny must be benched as a disciplinary action , and soon . his explanation for ysebaert jumping between him and lafontaine to score the winning goal yesterday ? wasn not my guy , ask patty about it . actually this stuff from mogilny doesn not surprise me all that much . about 4 or 5 weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex ; it went something like sarcastically yep , patty's the man . he's responsible for the team's success . i m a nobody around here . i was going to post it at the time . i must have forgot since nobody else was talking about him being a problem . if i heard that in the locker room , i would beat the shit out of him on the spot . patty took responsibility in the press , taking the heat off of alex . that's because lafontaine is the epitome of class , and a consummate team player . yep , i would beat the shit out of him too . lafontaine really must be a team player . makes you wonder what the islander management was thinking . my question is what the hell is muckler doing ? whether he wishes to admit it or not , the team is his to coach , and if he can not do the job then maybe the job should be given to somebody who can . gee , kinda like alex's spot on the team , isn not it ? dr.d the devils advocate

5			bible			 a little too satanic  you claimed that people that took the time to translate the bible would also take the time to get it right . but here in less than a couple generations you have been given ample proof agreed to by yourself above that the new versions tends to be out of step with other modern translations .  what i said was that people took time to copy the text correctly . translations present completely different issues . so why do i read in the papers that the qumram texts had different versions of some ot texts . did i misunderstand ? jon .

5			contradiction	jesus	meaning	christian	apostle	writing	truth	bible	interpretation	christ	god	belief	doctrine	mormon	scripture	faith			 lds rick's reply weiss says just briefly , on something that you mentioned in passing . you refer to differing interpretations of create , and say that many christians may not agree . so what ? that is really irrelevant . we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another , do we ? the bottom line is truth , regardless of popularity of opinions . i m sorry , i thought we were discussing heresy . i assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy , in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue . in this case , the definition of the word create is of great importance , since creation is the issue being discussed .  also , i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent , you say granted the mormon belief . you can not grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed . in order to reply to the issue , you have to address and answer the point that was raised , and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant . i should have said given the mormon belief . if you disagree with the mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation , then that is the important point . the bible states that lucifer was created . the bible states that jesus is the creator of all . the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same . correction you interpret the bible to mean something very specific by such terms. the mormon belief is that all are children of god . literally . there is nothing symbolic about it . this however , contradicts what the bible says . the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god  it always cracks me up when anti mormons presume to tell mormons what they believe . mormons do , in fact , believe that all people , including christ and lucifer , are children of god in the sense that we were all created or organized or whatever by him . we also believe that being offspring of god has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually born again of him . thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings . this is how language works , robert , and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous . this is really a red herring . it doesn not address any issue raised , but rather , it seeks to obfuscate . the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible , doesn not change what the bible teaches . for . we first look to the bible to see what it teaches . to discount , or not even address , what the bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is self defeating . to see what the bible teaches , you have to look at the bible . on the contrary , robert , it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the bible cannot seem to agree on what it says . you say that one must simply look at the bible to see what it teaches , but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says . are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures ? i find this rather curious . when i mentioned that the mormon belief is that jesus needed to be saved , i put forward some quotes from the late apostle , bruce mcconkie . the curious part is that no one addressed the issue of jesus needing to be saved . rick comes the closest with his i have my own conclusions to addressing the point . let me clarify this one more time . you did not refer to the mormon belief that jesus needed to be saved , but rather to mcconkie's belief in same . we keep trying to point out to you that bruce mcconkie is not the source of mormon doctrine , and you keep ignoring it . see below  most of the other replies have instead hop scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine . i don not think that it matters if mcconkie's views were canon . that is not the issue . were mcconkie's writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue . the indication from rick is that they may certainly be . on the contrary , robert , if you are quoting mcconkie's words as mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of great importance . the fact is that they are not . whether or not they indicate general mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of mormons .    robert weiss   rick anderson

1			isa	bus	ibm			 ide vs scsi , dma and detach originator can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why , if i get os 2 , i might need an scsi controler rather than an ide . will performance suffer that much ? for a 200mb or so drive ? if i don not have a tape drive or cd rom ? any help would be appreciated .  so , when you have got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do .  one way is with dma or bus mastering . either of these make it possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the cpu . the alternative is for the cpu to move the data . there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and bus mastering .  how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus ?  ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data bytes , with no dma .  if we are talking isa at bus here , then you can only have 1 dma channel active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device . so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus , explain how all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card to the isa at bus at the same time . think ! it's the scsi card doing the dma transfers not the disks . the scsi card can do dma transfers containing data from any of the scsi devices it is attached when it wants to . an important feature of scsi is the ability to detach a device . this frees the scsi bus for other devices . this is typically used in a multi tasking os to start transfers on several devices . while each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers . when the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data . on an ide bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it . this is typically a 10 20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time .  also , i m still trying to track down a copy of ibm's at reference book , but from their pc technical manual page 2 93  the fdd adapter is buffered on the i . o bus and uses the system board direct memory access dma for record data transfers . i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter . so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at hdd controller doesn not ! ! that makes real sense .   guy dawson hoskyns group plc . tel hoskyns uk 71 251 2128 tel ibm austin usa 512 838 3377

3			condition	march	bosnia	patient	facility	war	doctor	town	arm	street	mountain	medicine	victim	soldier			 from srebrenica doctoring in hell what it's like without modern medicine in war srebrenica's doctor recounts town's living hell  by laura pitter tuzla , bosnia , reuter neret mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged muslim town of srebrenica last august but after treating 4 , 000 mangled victims of bosnia's bloody war , he considers himself a surgeon . now i m a surgeon with great experience although i have no license to practice . but if i operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have . evacuated by the u.n. this week to his home town of tuzla , the muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year long serb siege of srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there . i lived through hell together with the people of srebrenica . all those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce , he told reporters . mujanovic , 31 , had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in tuzla , but before going to srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own . now he says he has performed major surgery 1 , 396 times , relying on books for guidance , amputating arms and legs 150 times , usually without anesthetic , delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections . he worked 18 to 19 hour days , slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last aug . 5 and treated 4 , 000 patients . he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from tuzla , 60 miles northwest of srebrenica . about 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain , he said . his worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field , killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102 . half of the dead were women and children . the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer . there was no warning . the blood flowed like a river in the street , he said . there were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together . one woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead . they had no heads . before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable , he said . many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools , facilities and medicine . the six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did . they didn not know the basic principles for amputating limbs . once he arrived the situation improved , he said , but by mid september he had run out of supplies . bandages were washed and boiled five times . sometimes they were falling apart in my hands , he said . doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding . people were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations , he said . blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types . i felt destroyed psychologically , mujanovic said . the situation improved after dec . 4 , when a convoy arrived from the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres . but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid december after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in the region . every day we had air strikes and shellings . then the hunger set in . between mid december and mid march , when u.s. planes began air dropping food , between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition , he said . i know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation , he said . according to mujanovic , around 5 , 000 people died in srebrenica , 1 , 000 of them children , during a year of siege . mujanovic plans to return to srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife , who is ill in tuzla . they say i m a hero , he said . there were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road , crying and waving when i left . and i cried too .  sharon machlis gartenberg framingham , ma usa email

4			bank	right	belief	minority	religion	border	god	territory			 islam borders vs israeli borders  what are the borders the islamic world dreams about ?  the islamic world dreams of being the whole planet , but not by kicking the current inhabitant out , we rather deam of the day everybody converts . if jews had the same dream , i would not feel threatened a bit . there certainly are muslims who do not believe that their dream of a global islamic community should be achieved through force . there are , however , others and , they are often far more visible vocal than the former who do accept the establishment of global islam through force . i would not feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing islamicization through peaceful means , nor by jews advocating the same approach . those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's power are certainly a threat . to palestinians , israel is doing just that ; maintaining its dominance of those outside its own group . if i am told that i am not one of you but you then impose your control on me , damn right you are a threat . if i am a member of a non muslim minority inside the islamic world and actively did not accept my minority status , i would also certainly see islam's domination as having been acheived , and maintained , through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities within their ranks .  islamic readers , i am waiting to your honest answer .  i want also a honest answer from zionists for the following questions i am not a zionist , but do feel that both jewish and palestinian nationalist desires need , at this juncture , to be accepted in some way .  1 why do jews who don not even believe in god as is the case with many of the founders of secular zionism have a right in palestine more than the inhabitants of palestine , just because god gave you the land ?  for the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous for islam to be spread by force upon those who do not want that . 2 why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel ? i refer to the most you also refer to because they are scared , and feel very threatened , as well feeling that this area is to some degree part of their belief religion heritage identity etc. i too strongly object to those that justify israeli rule of those who do not want that . the occupied territories are not israel's to control , to keep , or to dominate .  tim

4			murder	church	morality	violence			 freedom in u.s.a .  this is actually the law that david irving will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the holocaust it's too bad that this useless centre for policy research isn not in canada . it would set a nice precedent to how the law applies in cyberspace .  steve well canada is wrong . if it was in the us the aclu would have made sure that such repressive laws are found unconstitutional . do you think the church didn not find galileo's perception of the universe offensive . bull shit . there is no reason in the world why we can not say that taking views analogous to the kkk's or some such organization is wrong . there is no reason why some morality may not be legislated . as it is we do not allow theft , or murder , or rape . why should we allow hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence . harry .

3			country	population	prayer	cryptography	nsa	escrow	conversation	clipper	hundred	scheme	agency	key	crypto	chip			 the escrow database . here is a disturbing thought . now , we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets . we live in the electronic age . i asked myself , how big could the escrow database get ? how hard might it be to steal the whole thing , particularly were i an nsa official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses ? we can pretend that such will not happen , but thats naive . well , lets see . ten bytes of each escrow half . lets asume ten bytes of serial number in fact , i believe the serial number is smaller , but this is an order of magnitude calculation . we assume 250 10 6 as the population , and that each person has a key . i get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases . fits conveniently on a single very valuable exabyte tape . this can only get easier with time , but who cares i can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes . admittely , they will think of safeguards . they won not put the whole database on one disk , prehaps . maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way . this changes nothing they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types , so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval . at some point , with or without collusion by the agencies , those exabyte tapes are going to get cut . dorothy denning and david sternlight will doubtless claim this can not happen but we know that can not is a prayer , not a word that in this instance connotes realism . with two exabyte tapes in your pocket , you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands . yeah , you need the master key two but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places . come to think of it , even if the nsa getting a copy of the database isn not a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views , consider foreign intelligence services . you know , the ones that david sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do . the french apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets , so he isn not being completely irrational here although why our companies couldn not use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat . presumably , foreign intelligence services can get moles into the nsa and other agencies . we have proof by example of this its happened many times . presumably , someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys . you can not avoid that sort of thing . don not pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases . we crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system , and not on a secret . the escrow databases aren not the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about , but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category . imagine trying to replace 100 million clipper chips . i cannot believe that the nsa or whomever it is thats doing this doesn not realize all this already . they are too smart . there are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world . i suspect that they know precisely what they are doing and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography . i suspect that they realize that they can not put things off forever , but they can try to delay things as long as possible . who knows . maybe even some of the higher ups , the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization , really do believe that this scheme might give people some security , even as their subordinates in fort meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all .  perry metzger  laissez faire , laissez passer . le monde va de lui meme .

2			key	ibm	league	season	player	game	setup	content	team	workstation	baseball			 astros are back ! 2 astros relief corps holding together . if doug jones keeps his changeup effective and xavier hernandez can be effective , then it's passable . there's no reasonable left handed help , and the middle relief is iffy . tom edens was expected to take over the joe boever setup man role , but he's been injured , and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway . houston thought that boever would demand too much money , so they let him go . doug jones can lose his touch he went from cleveland's all star closer to the minors in a pretty short span .  from what i understand , boever and murphy were considered expendable by the  club . houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of players . art doug jones is the key to houston's success . he must have another great year for houston to challenge in the nl west no argument at all with murphy . he scared the hell out of me when he came in last year . on the other hand , the club though enough of boever to put him into an awful lot of games he may have led the league in appearances he did at least at some point . he seemed to be a very viable setup guy but i guess that's not considered that crucial by the club . i can just remember two years ago so well , though . . the unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the club so far . biggio and finley just aren not doing their job of getting on base . instead of filling his role as an rbi man , bagwell has had to assume biggio and finley's job . biggio concerns me , since he usually starts the season very strong . i m not that concerned . those guys have been relatively consistent over the years and they have no good reasons to decline no injuries , not old , . i expect them to come through just fine . it's those guys that have not been consistently good that are the worrisome part , even if they are coming through right now .   on a side note , are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next year's uniform ? there is talk that their road uniform will be blech . traditional grey , with the word houston written across the chest if i m not mistaken , their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange shiver . mclane's favorite color is red , so . this sounds like their old road unis . pretty dull . buttons or pullovers ? i will check through my uniform book to see if they have always had some orange . i m really upset . the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound horrible . i would like to see the uniform of the mid 1980s return . they may not have been pretty , but houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball and i liked it . well , we will see . i have got a astros pullover shirt with the astros stripes across the shoulders and i have trouble making myself wear it in public . i can see why they might want that to change . gee , if they eliminate the orange , will they reupholster the seats in the astros stripes section what used to be the gold and yellow levels i don not know those numbers they use now . i saw a pinstripe version of an astros cap and i actually thought it looked good !  marc stephenson ibm aws advanced workstations & systems austin , tx disclaimer the content of this posting is independent of official ibm position . internet vnet marc at ausvmq ibm t l 678 3189

 mr. stephanopoulos sure .  q did you , for instance , talk to the justice department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president ?  mr. stephanopoulos why don not we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the justice department and the white house . as you know and as we have said , the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday , sunday afternoon . they had a good discussion , about 15 minutes . the attorney general informed the president of what she wanted to do . he raised no objections . obviously , she had the implicit authority from the president to go forward he raised no objections . she went forward they had a discussion of a general nature about the incident .  again , yesterday morning around 11 00 am , the president spoke with the attorney general again . they had a brief discussion over what was happening in waco . as you know , this was before the fire broke out at the compound . and i think that was why there was some just some confusion . i think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire , not the actual day when they spoke .  then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the white house yesterday afternoon between the justice department and the white house . they were informing us of  their decisions , what they would like to do . there was an fbi briefing in waco . the attorney general had her press conference . the president then issued a statement after that .  frankly , yesterday afternoon , you know , there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in waco , and i think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the president say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground . once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in waco , the president issued a statement . he spoke with the attorney general again yesterday evening .  q at what hour was that ?  mr. stephanopoulos it was quite late . i believe it was after he returned from the holocaust museum . he took a tour of the holocaust museum last night .  q and he went out to dinner .  mr. stephanopoulos i believe briefly . yes , he went to dinner and then he spoke with the attorney general last night . i don not know the exact time ; i think it was relatively late . and he just said , i think as dee dee has reported , that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well , that she did a good job in a tough situation , and that she should try and get some sleep . he then , again , spoke with her this morning about the follow up in waco , and about what they are going to do this afternoon . as you know , the president will have an announcement to make at 1 15 .  q did he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday , last night , or this morning ?  mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge , no.  q was webb hubbell the point man for the white house ?  mr. stephanopoulos webb hubbell is the general white house liaison and several people talked to webb . the attorney general was running the operation .  q did he tell her that she should sleep well , that she had done a good job ? or he just tell her that she should get some sleep ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think sleep well done a good job i don not know the exact words . i think that sounds right .  q i mean , sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not .  mr. stephanopoulos well , i mean , i think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when  q i understand that , but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology .  mr. stephanopoulos i think that's the spirit no , it has nothing to do with that . the spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general had to face a very difficult decision , a very difficult situation yesterday . and that he thought that she had handled it well , as best as she could and  q well , does he think it was mishandled ?   mr. stephanopoulos it was just speaking of warm words to a friend .  q does he think the situation was mishandled ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president  q in retrospect ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies , the decisions of the attorney general . he accepts full responsibility . at the same time , i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened , do a full review , and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn not happen this kind of thing doesn not happen again , or at least we know how to handle it .  q how much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with ? i know that she made the case to him explained outlined the case for action . did she say to him on sunday precisely what action ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen . i think that they had a general discussion about the action , about the advisability of action . i think , as she noted , he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered . but it wasn not minute by minute detail of how the operation  q well , was it , we are going in . is it , we are going to use tear gas ? i mean , what ?  mr. stephanopoulos i believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound , and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out .  q george , was there ever a conscious political decision made , or even a discussion about distancing the president from  mr. stephanopoulos not at all . i mean , we were in close contact with the justice department . the president accepts responsibility for this . at the same time i mean , we just wanted to be very , very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made . it is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations . the attorney general has operational control over this . the president obviously accepts responsibility for all of this , and he stands by the attorney general .  q george , there was a report on the television today and i don not know more than that one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the fbi had started the fire and not themselves . there was also a picture yesterday on the tv of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out . and my question is , is the white house absolutely certain that this fire was   mr. stephanopoulos all the evidence we have is that this fire was started by david koresh and those inside the compound every bit of evidence we have .  q did the president ask the attorney general why do this now , why this particular date , and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury ?   mr. stephanopoulos i don not know the specific questions . he had general questions about how the decision was going about being made .  q those are general questions and did he ask generally , why now ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think he asked , have you considered all of the consequences ; have you considered the recommendations ? i don not know if he asked the question , why now ? i don not know if he asked that specific question .  q did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that's come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about koresh getting increasingly more violent ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , i m not certain how much specific detail they got into . i know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she's prepared to make , i mean , the decision she's prepared to make . it's based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved . again , i do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that .  q what is the president's understanding why yesterday ? one of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action . why yesterday ?  mr. stephanopoulos this is the first i have heard i think what we can go to is what the fbi and the attorney general has said . there were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger . it was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all .  there was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work . and as the attorney general has said , there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them , and there was a concern over the safety .  all of these factors came into play . they also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on david koresh and those in the compound . i would just go back to what the attorney general has said . you have to make the best judgment you can , given the information you have at the time . they did . obviously , we all regret the loss of life . it's a terribly unfortunate situation . we all wish it could have turned out differently , but that doesn not take away from the judgments that were made at the time .  q george , when did the president know that they were going to use tear gas ? was it before the assault on the compound ?  mr. stephanopoulos i just don not know . i don not believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go . i just don not know .  q along that point , george , can you say whether the plan was presented to the president by the attorney general as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday ?   mr. stephanopoulos i think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and , we all hoped , as a way to move some of those out and bring it in it wasn not presented as tomorrow is d day , this is it .  q is the president satisfied that , a , he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision , and b , that janet reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision ?  mr. stephanopoulos oh , i think he's satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had , and he's not second guessing it in any way whatsoever .  q george , was there a 12 hour gap between conversations between the president and the attorney general ? in other words , they spoke at 11 00 am and they didn not speak again until clinton got back from dinner at  mr. stephanopoulos i think that's likely , yes .  q did he call her ? what time did she call ? was there a gap between when she called him ? i mean , was he at dinner when she called and  mr. stephanopoulos no , no , no. i think he called her last night . i couldn not swear to it , but i believe he called her last night . he just wanted to talk to her .  q what was going on ?  mr. stephanopoulos not that i know of , no.  q what do you know about the situation now ? everyone has perished who except eight or nine ? and do you know any of the other details ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know any more details than the fbi reported in waco .  q watching cnn or how was he keeping track of what is going on ? if he wasn not talking to his attorney general , how was he keeping track of what was going on here ? i mean , with all due respect to cnn , is that how he was doing it ?  mr. stephanopoulos no. there was also as i said , several people in the white house were in constant contact with their counterparts at justice to have the full and complete information .  q who were those contacts ? i mean , was it mack mclarty , webb hubbell ? how was the president being kept informed ? that's not a  mr. stephanopoulos i believe mack was in contact with webb . i spoke with several people at the justice department . i believe bruce lindsey spoke with people at the justice department . either bernie or vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the justice department . we were fully briefed and fully informed .  q we were told this morning that the president may have spoken a chance that he may have spoken with webb . do you know if that's true or not ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think there's a chance he may have . i don not believe he did , but i think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point . i don not believe he did . i think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with  the justice department was the 11 00 am phone call with the attorney general . but the white house was fully informed on a minute to minute basis of what was happening in waco and what was happening at the justice department .  q george , who decided that the briefing would be done by the attorney general ?  mr. stephanopoulos the attorney general .  q did you or did the white house communications staff were you ever involved with that decision ?  mr. stephanopoulos no. we were told about it .  q did you ask her to go on nightline and macneil lehrer and all that stuff ? was that part of  mr. stephanopoulos no.  q there was no advice from the white house at all about her she was on all night , all day . laughter .  mr. stephanopoulos yes , and she did a very good job .  q why did you decide to have the president's reaction to the situation be only a written statement , which is traditionally the white house's way of distancing the president from the issue , not having him appear as personally saying anything ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , that wasn not the intent at all . as i said , we had to we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand . the president is also making a statement today . the president made a statement yesterday morning . the president has been fully involved  q after this turned into less than a successful operation , the only statement from the president was what was on paper after the attorney general had already given what amounted to the major facts in this .  mr. stephanopoulos well , it was the first statement from the president , not the only statement from the president , number one .  q after the  mr. stephanopoulos number two well , the first number two , the attorney general  q he gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move  mr. stephanopoulos right . and he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today . now , the second point  q it just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved ? it was the president wants to put out a written statement ?  mr. stephanopoulos knowing what we knew at the time , we thought it was appropriate for the president and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the attorney general's  q why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something ?   mr. stephanopoulos well , he did personally do so . that is his statement . it's a statement under his name .  q george , yesterday during the briefing you didn not say the president took full responsibility for what happened  mr. stephanopoulos i certainly did .  q no , what you said was  mr. stephanopoulos that's just not right , susan .  q well , i think you can go back to the transcript , i mean , unless i miss something  mr. stephanopoulos i would love to .  q janet reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision , that the fbi   mr. stephanopoulos and the president takes responsibility . absolutely .  q took responsibility all right .  mr. stephanopoulos check the transcript .  q considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and , even now , how little is known , why is washington calling this a mass suicide ?  mr. stephanopoulos well , i think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of david koresh before and during , it is painfully clear that those there were under his control .  q it's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned , though , isn not it , george ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think that that is an entirely different matter . i mean , i think that david koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children , absolutely . but he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident , and that's what he did .  q you are still operating completely on assumption , right ? i mean , you have no evidence , or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide .  mr. stephanopoulos we have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound , which led to the deaths of those inside .  q i didn not quite hear it . this might be ann's question , i didn not quite hear it . but at what time did clinton himself put out a statement on this ? i know dee dee said some stuff on this at 6 00 pm , but the president put out  mr. stephanopoulos at 6 35 pm , 6 40 pm  q right after the evening news went on the air ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , right when we had all the information . we were working on it .   q dee dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the president is going to announce is going to be an administration run investigation . why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a political stake , particularly those at the atf whose actions have already been  mr. stephanopoulos i think that clearly the atf and the justice department will bear responsibility for the investigation . that's not to rule out , as is often in investigations like this , having some sort of independent involvement as well . but it will be run by the treasury and justice .  q are you confident that you will not have any problem getting  mr. stephanopoulos absolutely .  q george , did the president reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with janet reno ? and who else in the white house sat in on that meeting ? anyone else from justice ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not believe anybody else was there at the time . it was a phone call on monday , it wasn not a meeting .  q sunday .  mr. stephanopoulos sunday . it was a phone call , it wasn not a meeting . i believe he might have been there with bruce , but beyond that , i think he just talked to the attorney general .  q george , you said that in that phone call , she said that we want to go in and take action , as you said , that will force him out . what did he think she was talking about ? if he didn not know about tear gas , what exactly was his idea of what he was approving ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on  qq it didn not matter how she did that ?  mr. stephanopoulos no , no. i mean  q what information did he have in terms of how this would proceed ? presumably he would have wanted to know , not minute by minute , but in a general sense  mr. stephanopoulos i think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies . i just don not know  q what is this when you say that this was the recommendation  mr. stephanopoulos the action to increase pressure . i don not know exactly what he was told whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window , or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure . i just don not know .  q it's hard to imagine him not asking , though .  q that janet reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with , he would have agreed ?   mr. stephanopoulos he was he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave . at the same time and i would repeat that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved .  q george , it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the president was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere . can you take that question and  mr. stephanopoulos absolutely . yes .  q get the answer and come back to us with all of it ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q can you tell us that there was never a meeting a strategy session where you and others decided , we will put out a written statement from the president and we will have janet reno be on all of these television broadcasts ?  mr. stephanopoulos never . never .  q and you never called the justice department and said to anyone or janet reno , you are the one who needs to be out front explaining this ?  mr. stephanopoulos not once .  q it just happened that way that she was the spokesman , that no one ever saw bill sessions until  mr. stephanopoulos she made a decision as attorney general that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge , as the person who made the decision , to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident .  q she had no guidance from the white house at all ?  mr. stephanopoulos we certainly didn not object .  q but did you laughter no , i m sure you didn not object , but did you suggest it ? was this a plan  mr. stephanopoulos no. absolutely not .  q a strategy ?  mr. stephanopoulos no.  q did she clear it ?  mr. stephanopoulos no.  q did she notify you ?  mr. stephanopoulos we certainly knew about it .  q what happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the justice department ?   mr. stephanopoulos the attorney general made the decision and the attorney general wanted to go forward it seemed like a good decision . it was a good decision . she did a good job .  q let me ask it this way , george , if in hindsight how you would handle it ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think it was handled very well .  q you wouldn not change a thing if  mr. stephanopoulos change what ?  q the way the white house handled any part of it from start to finish .  mr. stephanopoulos well , i think that's an awful broad question and we are certainly going to have a review . one of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them . if you are talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences , no , there wouldn not make any change at all .  q two questions first of all , on her going on tv , no white house people or outside media consultants came up with this idea ? it's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign .  mr. stephanopoulos how so ?  q i m thinking of like watching clinton on nightline after the draft story ; watching clinton on  mr. stephanopoulos there's absolutely no comparison . yesterday there was a law enforcement incident . the incident ended in tragic deaths of many , many people . the attorney general was involved in that decision . the attorney general made the decision to do that . she felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered , and she did a fantastic job .  q the second question is , did as someone who knows clinton as well as you do , can you understand why it's sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do ? in other words , she came and she said , i m going to put pressure on them . it's hard not to see clinton , who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive , asking how .  q what kind ?  mr. stephanopoulos both the attorney general said that he did ask questions , he did ask general questions . i don not have a minute by minute account of the conversation .  q how long a conversation ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think it was about 15 minutes .  q telephone conversation ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q george , was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure   mr. stephanopoulos i don not believe so , no.  q george , you keep saying that the president takes full responsibility , but then you refer to it as her decision . does the president not accept the fact that as commander in chief , it is ultimately his decision ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know what this has to do with commander in chief . this was a law enforcement action , not a military action . and he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government . i mean , i think there's just no ambiguity about that .  q but is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers , or is he saying it's her decision ? there's a difference .  mr. stephanopoulos as a matter of fact , it was her decision . he did not object to that decision . he clearly takes full responsibility .  q george , this briefing has gone on just a little over 15 minutes , and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged . what exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general ? that's a long period of time in a phone conversation .  mr. stephanopoulos it is an awful long phone conversation . it was a very important phone conversation . i think brit has asked that we take the question , and i have said that i would .  q one of the things reno said last night is that the buck stops here . i think that was her direct quotation . does the president agree with that in this case ?  mr. stephanopoulos the president says he accepts full responsibility . i think what the attorney general was saying is that she made a decision , that she's going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her . and she's not shrinking from that at all , but neither is the president .  q at any point in the conversation last night between the president and the attorney general or this morning , did she ever offer her a resignation ?  mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge .  q even before the fire was out yesterday , there were some republicans on capitol hill calling for an investigation . is the white house at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation ?  mr. stephanopoulos no. and i don not want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation . we want an investigation , and we will have a full and complete investigation .  q in what forum will you answer brit's question ? will you put out a written statement ? will you the wires ? how will you answer the question that you have taken ?  mr. stephanopoulos i m just not sure .  q george , can you remind us what the president was doing all yesterday afternoon , where he was , and what meetings he was involved in ?  mr. stephanopoulos i will have to try and remember . he had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during  the afternoon . he was certainly monitoring the situation in waco and getting periodic reports on that as well . he did see some on cnn as well . i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi press briefing as well .  q and those reports would have come to him from mack mclarty , would they do you think ?  mr. stephanopoulos mack talked to him , bruce talked to him , i talked to him .  q george , to follow helen's question , in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign ? did he say , i don not know why you felt the need to say that ? i m here to reassure you that you don not have to do this ? did that come up at all ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if it even came up that specifically . i know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation   q the didn not talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about  mr. stephanopoulos well , i believe she was asked a question .  q and her response was , if the president wants me to , i will .  mr. stephanopoulos which would be , i think , the standard response that most cabinet members would give . i mean , it's a conditional statement .  q have a need to talk about whether personally about whether the president wanted her  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know if they talked about it . i mean , what i learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself . and this just didn not come up . i did not ask the question if they talked about  q will you take that with the brit package ?  mr. stephanopoulos certainly . laughter .  q george , for the record , does the president want her to resign ? i know dee dee answered this morning  mr. stephanopoulos absolutely not . he supports janet reno. she's a good attorney general . she's done a good job . she handled a difficult situation extremely well .  q george , does the president feel that he and janet reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground ?  mr. stephanopoulos no. and the president is not second guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way . that is not to say that he doesn not regret the loss of life . everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation . but the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had .   q george , the 15 minute conversation was the one on sunday , is that correct ?  mr. stephanopoulos yes .  q how long was the one at 11 00 am yesterday morning ?  mr. stephanopoulos i don not know . i will take that question , too .  q were these outside experts that they were consulting with , or experts within the atf and the fbi ?  mr. stephanopoulos you would have to ask them . i m just not sure . i know that there were several experts .  q and also , why weren not there replacements for these people ? is the unit that small ?  mr. stephanopoulos again , i think it is a very small highly specialized unit . but i think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine .  q george , isn not there a factor here involving the fbi director ? normally , a president , when he wants to get information , doesn not only asks the attorney general . i know the chain of command . but presidents talk to their fbi directors . in this case , throughout this entire siege , he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill sessions , who is from waco , and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do ?  mr. stephanopoulos i think he talked to the fbi director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in waco . at the same time , the attorney general bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the attorney general .  q don not you think the ambiguous situation that director sessions is in has some impact on the way the president is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved ?  mr. stephanopoulos not at all . i mean , it's perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the attorney general and that the attorney general has supervisory authority over the fbi director , and that's following the chain of command .  the press thank you . end 1 03 pm edt  60 04 20
1			improvement	screen	right	sale	key			 perfect mag mx15f monitors ? i have been intently following the mag thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail . there seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx15f . one article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec 1 4 . that figure 1 4 for image rotation would seem to be a little high . on my nec 5fg the specs call for no greater than 3mm 0 . 12 . well , my monitor arrived last night and , sure enough , it has a very noticable barrel distortion . it's not dramatic , but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn not fill the entire screen . the fact that it is worse on the right side doesn not help matters .  what i m trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect ? i don not want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem . does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment ? i can not speak for mag innovision but as far as nec is concerned , they are adjusted to factory spec before leaving the central usa distribution point ma for the eastern canadian market . now , here's the key nec knows that the 15 monitors adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances with all the bumps , rough handling , and such and therefore expect and at least in theory require that the local distributor not dealer have it adjusted at the local service centre bull hn information systems in toronto before sale . this is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is , in my case quite . are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections ? i , for one , was not willing to accept what i considered a substandard monitor and , after two months of wrangling and direct contact with nec , finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor not perfect , imho , but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was normal . the short answer is no , don not accept these imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors , one has a right to expect higher quality , and if you are persistent , you will receive it . . comments and opinions are mine not bnr's doug adcock bell northern research research triangle park , nc . regards , paul yee

5			religion	god	jesus	passage	bible			 the pope is jewish ! last night , while watching the 2am rebroadcast of jerry springer a talk show i heard this jewel of a thought from a 12 year old racist the focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the jewish religion , and why . some stuff deleted interesting and scary no ? they went on to say how the jews had killed their god , and how in the end of time that all the races would go to their homelands of course , they would remain in america , which is new jeruselem , as it says in gen 2 ? what another kid said but the rest of the races would go home and then the great battle or plague or whatever revel . says would happen , and the jews would be killed .  the most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is catholic , and had the kjv of the bible on his desk . he immediatly opened it up and began to search for the quoted passages gen , rev , and john to look for himself , and couldn not find what they said they saw . i don not know i saw this show a while back , and when i heard these kids quote the bible to justify their racist claims , i looked up that quote about jesus hating jews since jesus himself was a jew , my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim . the jist of the passage and i am sorry but i can not recall which passage it was exactly was that jesus was condemning the pharisees for being corrupt . of course , the pharisees were jewish too , but it wasn not jews as a whole that jesus was condemning , just the powers that be .  nancy o connor psychology undergrad the opinions i express simon fraser university , are my own . burnaby , b . c . canada

mate ! i m only a poor plant scientist , i don not know how to make kill files . my k key works overtime as it is just to then what seems to be the problem ? did you ever read newspaper at all ? painful search . the gruesome extent of february's killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about 600 men , women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four year war over nagorny karabakh . the figure is drawn from azeri investigators , hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press . diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates . the 25 february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh , the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday . the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre , but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians . the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku . later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2 , 000 dead . the state prosecuter , aydin rasulov , the cheif investigator of a 15 man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster , said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings . a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov , the mayor of hojali . an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified . this figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova , the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence . francois zen ruffinen , head of delegation of the international red cross in baku , said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from hojali , most of them civilians . we did not count the bodies . but the figure seems reasonable . it is no fantasy , mr zen ruffinen said . we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead . mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre . don not get worked up . it will take several months to get a final figure , the 43 year old lawyer said at his small office . mr rasulov knows about these things . it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january 1990 . those nationalists , the popular front , finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali , an azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with armenia , fell to the armenians . officially , 184 people have so far been certified as dead , being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department . this is just a small percentage of the dead , said rafiq youssifov , the republic's chief forensic scientist they were the only bodies brought to us . remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours . of these 184 people , 51 were women , and 13 were children under 14 years old . gunshots killed 151 people , shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10 . exposure in the highland snows killed the last three . thirty three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation , including ears , noses , breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out , according to professor youssifov's report . those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed , mr rasulov said . files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised lists of 44 azeri militiamen are dead here , six policemen there , and in handwriting of a mosque attendant , the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day . the most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov , an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on 27 february . there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly 470 500 in hojali , 650 700 people by the stream and the road and 85 100 visible around nakhchivanik village , mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot . people waved up to us for help . we saw three dead children and one two year old alive by one dead woman . the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up . we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return . there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces . the independent , london , 12 6 92 heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe bar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers , torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago , writes hugh pope . i m still wearing the same clothes , i don not have any others , the 51 year old carpenter said , beginning his account of the hojali disaster . i was wounded in five places , but i am lucky to be alive . mr sadikov and his wife were short of food , without electricity for more than a month , and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days . they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh . at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before , eight or nine kinds of weapons , artillery , heavy machine guns , the lot , mr sadikov said . soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack . some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town , down a hill , through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side . to escape , the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about 15 miles away . they thought they were going to make it , until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak . none of my group was hurt up to then . then we were spotted by a car on the road , and the armenian outposts started opening fire , mr sadikov said . azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians , but their efforts were mostly in vain . mr sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through , including his wife and militiaman son . seven of his immediate relations died , including his 67 year old elder brother . i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat , he said , pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes . we have never got any of the bodies back . the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire . one hero of the evacuation , alif hajief , was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing , mr sadikov said . another hero , elman memmedov , the mayor of hojali , said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 february in the bushy hillside , surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay . as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam , there was little comfort in a town from

here is the context for the question this is not true for everyone on this board , and you are out of line in assuming that it is .  you , however , deleted the text further along where i said that i didn not mean  whether or not you mean to make such implications , you do so repeatedly .  allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that you have come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize ? 2 . you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by , and when pressed , you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation . i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason . you failed to do so . please do so now . question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning ? here is the context for the question revelation is not reason , and if we do have revelation , then reasoning is not all we have . first , show me that revelation exists . second , if revelation is not perceived through the senses , how exactly is it perceived ? according to my webster's , revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine truth . now , tell me how such a thing can be revealed communicated other than via the senses ? tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason , that is , using your brain to interpret what you are sensing . when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain , it is because this is the simple truth . if you have another mechanism of interface , by all means , share it with us . then later . you cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason , period .  again , this is indefensible .  no , it is simple truth . i challenge you to show me otherwise . then later . few mystics will agree to this assertion , and the common defense of redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than others .  i allow you the broadest definition of senses , to make things easier for you . now , show me that mystical experiences exist remember , you aren not allowed to go by testimony of others e.g . mystics , since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable you know , tainted by my own bias . further , once these mystical thingies are absorbed , show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that person's reasoning capabilities .  i challenge you to show me these things . if you cannot do so , you might as well give up the fight . then later . let me reiterate , you have not explained your interpretation of your experiences , so it is not possible for me to have attacked them . in point of fact , i specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about , and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge .  what is it ? how is it sensed ? how is it interpreted ? and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities ? you have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims. if you can not answer them , your claims are entirely specious . 3 . you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a . a posters are unverifiable and fantastical . i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made . you have failed to do so . please do so now . question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical ? if so , please repeat them . here is the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong posting . then later . likewise , the reference to unverifiable , fantastical claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group .  give me your address and i will be pleased to send you a dictionary . failing that , can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical ? i demand that you retract this statement if you cannot offer up evidence . if you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge , then you are simply an asshole . 4 . first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason , then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn not help but become atheist i asked you to explain the contradiction . your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent , an opinion not shared by others that i have asked , be they atheist or theist you have failed to answer the question . please do so now . question do you retract your claim that a . a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason , despite their testimony to that effect ? if you don not retract that claim , do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism ? here is the context for the question first quote . we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason . it is up to atheists to prove it to me .  then ,  second quote . but i do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of view . 5 . first , you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts . later , you implied that you wouldn not respond because i was putting words in your mouth . please clarify this seeming contradiction . question do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts , or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text ? here is the context for the question first you said or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen . these are not rules of morality , but practicality . then later . if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position , then they cannot be argued with . as usual , your responses are awaited with anticipation . dave wood ps , for the record , below is a compilation of charley's responses to these challenges to date . 3 18 93 this makes no sense to me at all ; it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence , or of answering some question of mr. wood's imagination . 3 31 93 1 mr. wood , i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response whatsoever . at some point i might read and respond to your article , and then again , i might not . my ordinary rules are nothing but included text on the first screen . these are not rules of morality , but practicality . 3 31 93 2 i left out something else i don not respond to . . utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments meta arguments , as some call them . 4 3 93 when i have to start saying that's not what i said , and the response is did so ! there's no reason to continue . if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position , then they cannot be argued with .

second volume in a trilogy that began with the coherence of theism 1977 and was concluded with faith and reason 1981 . in this work , swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of god . his arguments , which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived , were decisively rejected in mackie's the miracle of theism . in the revised edition of the existence of god , swinburne includes an appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie . j . l . mackie the miracle of theism , oxford this posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of god . it ranges from the classical philosophical positions of descartes , anselm , berkeley , hume et al , through the moral arguments of newman , kant and sidgwick , to the recent restatements of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne . it also addresses those positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational , such as those of kierkegaard , kung and philips , as well as replacements for god such as lelie's axiarchism . the book is a delight to read less formalistic and better written than martin's works , and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand

american cryptographic association . rsa public key patents . x last updated 1993 04 16 archive name cryptography faq part09 last modified 1993 4 15 faq for sci . crypt , part 9 other miscellany this is the ninth of ten parts of the sci . crypt faq . the parts are mostly independent , but you should read the first part before the rest we don not have the time to send out missing parts by mail , so don not ask . notes such as kah67 refer to the reference list in the last part . the sections of this faq are available via anonymous ftp to rtfm . mit . edu as pub usenet news . answers cryptography faq part xx . the cryptography faq is posted to the newsgroups sci . crypt , sci . answers , and news . answers every 21 days . contents what is the national security agency nsa ? what are the us export regulations ? what is tempest ? what are the beale ciphers , and are they a hoax ? what is the american cryptogram association , and how do i get in touch ? is rsa patented ? what about the voynich manuscript ? what is the national security agency nsa ? the nsa is the official security body of the u.s. government . it was given its charter by president truman in the late 40's , and has continued research in cryptology till the present . the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world , and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world . governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists . the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art , and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice ; but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified . bamford's book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa . the following quote from massey mas88 highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography . if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government , one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors . without doubt , the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology . for only about 10 years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology . there have been , and will continue to be , conflicts between these two research communities . open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals . but can a government agency , charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations , countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break ? can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code breakers ? one might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson's gentlemen , but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields . the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology , but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild . what are the us export regulations ? in a nutshell , there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software . one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce , authorized by the export administration regulations ear . another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department , authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar . as a rule of thumb , bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements , but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa . the newsgroup misc . legal . computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export , what people think about those laws , and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci . crypt . make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail ; if you are lucky , your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the itar . what is tempest ? tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment . it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e.g . from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort . needless to say , encryption doesn not do much good if the cleartext is available this way . what are the beale ciphers , and are they a hoax ? thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections . the story in a pamphlet by j . b . ward 1885 goes thomas jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in bedford county , virginia , leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper ; the ciphers describe the location , contents , and intended beneficiaries of the treasure . ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called b2 ; it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the declaration of independence doi as key . b1 and b3 are unsolved ; many documents have been tried as the key to b1 . aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b1 by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure the beale cypher association po box 975 beaver falls , pa 15010 you can get the ciphers from the rec . puzzles faql by including the line send index in a message to and following the directions . there are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating around . the correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet , says john king . some believe the story is a hoax . kruh kru88 gives a long list of problems with the story . gillogly gil80 decrypted b1 with the doi and found some unexpected strings , including abfdefghiijklmmnohpp . hammer president of the beale cypher association agrees that this string couldn not appear by chance , but feels there must be an explanation ; gwyn sci . crypt expert is unimpressed with this string . what is the american cryptogram association , and how do i get in touch ? the aca is an organization devoted to cryptography , with an emphasis on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with pencil and paper or computers . its organ the cryptogram includes articles and challenge ciphers . among the more than 50 cipher types in english and other languages are simple substitution , playfair , vigenere , bifid , bazeries , grille , homophonic , and cryptarithm . dues are $ 15 for one year 6 issues ; more outside of north america ; less for students under 18 and seniors . subscriptions should be sent to aca treasurer , 18789 west hickory st , mundelein , il 60060 . is rsa patented ? yes . the patent number is 4 , 405 , 829 , filed 12 14 77 , granted 9 20 83 . for further discussion of this patent , whether it should have been granted , algorithm patents in general , and related legal and moral issues , see comp . patents and misc . legal . computing . for information about the league for programming freedom see ftppf . note that one of the original purposes of comp . patents was to collect questions such as should rsa be patented ?

3			bank	kingdom	communication	fan	technology	agency	arm	town	price	industry	space	satellite	russia	team	russian	launch	concept	relation	right			 rimsat , us russian joint venture i have been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i have transcribed some of my notes below . since my note taking ability is by no means infallible , please assume that all factual errors are mine . permission is granted to copy this without restriction . michael sternberg , cheif of operations of rimsat , was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois . acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control , disarmament and international security . rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites . i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program . the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson ? went to tonga to visit a friend . while he was there , he somehow ended up visiting the king , who happened to be a big tv fan . matt bought the king a satellite dish , which the king thought was really nifty . since tonga has a gnp of about $ 70 million , his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this . matt thought there probably was , so at his suggestion , tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots . while this isn not entirely off the wall , it was very unusual , seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program , and 31 is a lot of slots . the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga's case . eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots , ranging from 70 e to 170 e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside . according to sternberg , four of these , from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim . rimsat was formed to use these slots . it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven . they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west , however , to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $ 2 billion . it's not easy to raise that kind of money . eventually , they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware . they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware . mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i don not think i will visit there for a long time . besides a significant lack of creature comforts , he was not happy with the way that people operate . for example everybody can sell you everything . everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by . eventually , rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $ 150 million . however , glavkosmos lost favor after the coup . sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures . since glavkosmos was out of power , he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities . he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms. eventually , he worked out a deal and on dec 4 , 1992 he met with koptev , who heads the russian space program , to sign the deal . koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat . the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware , npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym . this organization is located in siberia can not figure out how to spell the town , i need an atlas and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age . sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites . they are hard workers , honest people who team up to get things done , very much like midwesterners . at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm . his company is apparently lookng for $ 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partners . it apparently costs the russians about $ 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $ 50 million in the west if you want to give them specifications , they will build you a satellite . for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using , costs run about $ 378 , 000 per transponder year . this compares to $ 810 , 000 t y in the u.s. they can sell their time for about $ 1 . 1 million compared to $ 2 . 6 million in the u.s. rimsat will launch their satellites on protons . to get the best prices , they bought in bulk . they have the rights to twelve launches , so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address . the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians , which is being moved into place now . tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs , not big business because big business is just like what they have over there , except that we have better paper , both in the bathroom and in the copier . russian launches are self insured . the promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months . major investors in rimsat include russell 20 20 , which is a huge retirement fund organization , cellsat , which is a big telecom business in southeast asia , and a fund operated by some of the big names in u . s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off . he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren not used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith . italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don not worry because we are used to it . he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we won not worry about their stability as much . part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money . the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments , putting 25 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles . to get around this , rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account . npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government . one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry . however , intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites , which was rather reassuring . the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime . the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years , while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years . while this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites , sternberg downplayed the difference . at these prices they can afford to launch new ones . in addition , shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older , out of date hardware .  josh hopkins find a way or make one . attributed to hannibal

5			god	bible	roman	christ	scripture	neighbor	paul	love	sinner	spirit	christianity	jesus	christian	sin	testament			 hate the sin . subject hate the sin . hate the sin but love the sinner . i have heard that quite a bit recently , my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity . i would think not . hate begets more hate , never love . if you are questioning whether or not hating sin is consistent with christianity ; i ask you to consider the following scripture romans 12 9 let love be without hypocrisy . hate what is evil , cling to what is good . what is it that paul , through the inspiration of the holy spirit is calling us to hate ? would god call us to do something that would eventually lead to hating our fellow man ; especially when he commands us to do the opposite , to love your fellow man ? consider some sin . now lets apply our hate the sin . philosophy and see what happens . if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the stronger our hatred of it will become . eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner . that has not been my experience . i have not found myself hating anybody as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life . as a sinner myself , i find myself having more compassion for the person . jesus too , since the bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are , is able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall . jesus is our very example of how to hate the sin but love the sinner . in the account of the woman caught in adultery john 8 , jesus had compassion on the woman ; but he also called her to leave her life of sin . this is what it means to love sinners but hate their sin ; it means loving them unconditionally , while at the same time calling them to leave their sin . in addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin . the blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the christian . i have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it . it was not unloving for the christian to call me out of sin ; in fact , i believe it was the most loving thing that that person could have done . he loved me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin . after enough of this , the sinner begins to hate us they certainly don not love us for our constant criticism of their behavior . hate builds up and drives people away from god . this certainly cannot be a good way to build love . again , i don not think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of the christian . if we have loved them as jesus loved sinners exemplified in john 8 and the sinner hates us for it , then we have done the best we can . we will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have rejected it . now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner , then indeed , we will , ourselves , be in sin . in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors . he doesn not say anything about hate . i would like to encourage you to do a word study on hate in the new testament . i really think that you will be surprised . in fact , if anything , he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves . criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent . hope this helps , in christ , tony balsamo   name antonio l . balsamo company digital equipment corporation shrewsbury , mass . work 508 841 2039 email

5			birth	church	god	christ	fallacy	truth	religion	jesus	satan	mary	messiah			 it's all mary's fault !  deletion lucky for them that the baby didn not have any obvious deformities ! i could just see it now mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and joseph say that it was god that got her pregnant and then the baby turns out to be deformed , or even worse , stillborn ! they would have a lot of explaining to do .  a few points guys , oops guy and gal but i use the term guy asexually  has the same sort of conspiracy ever occurred since , i mean there must have been dozen of times in the past two thousand years when it would have been opportune time for a messiah to be born .   it has . there is a guy running around in switzerland who claims to have been conceived similarly . his mother says the same . his father is said to be a bit surprised .  but anyway , there have been a lot of messiahs , and many have had a similar story about their birth . or their death . a list of messiahs could be quite interesting .   wouldn not you feel bad if you turned out to be wrong and the conception of christ was via god ? i can just imagine your faces as mary asks you if you have ever had a child yourself .   i would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing evidence for everyone to check . and the whole question is absurd  wouldn not you feel bad if you would find out that stones are sentient , and that you have stepped on them all your life ? and wouldn not you feel bad when you would see the proof that jesus was just a plot of satan ?   if they wanted to save image they could have done what joseph planned to do in the first place have a quite wedding and an equally quite divorce , i think it was quite easy to do under jewish law . in that regard they would have been pretty dumb to think up a conspiracy like the one you have outlined in that they a bringing attention on themselves . messiah appearances were like royal scandals in zero ad israel , see the part in acts when the sandhedrin are discussing what to do about the growth of the new church , i.e. one wise guy said leave it alone and if it is what it says it is nothing can stop it and if it isn not then it will just fizzle out anyway .   you have forgotten the pride factor .   it didn not fizzle , the church i mean .   the argument is a fallacy . it is like thanks for reading this far on the end of a letter . most religions claim that they won not fizzle because they contain some eternal truth . so does christianity . since there are old religions it is no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last  roll twelve dice . calculate the chance for the result . argue that there must be something special about the result because an event with a chance of 1 6 12 could hardly happen by chance only . feel elevated because you have participated in letting that special event take place . benedikt

4			firearm	street	police	car	incident	statistic	crime	shooting	weapon	country	messiah	compound	violence	disease	gun	handgun			 gun buy back   . gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths , domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime .  what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things ? evidence , please ?  please don not misinterret what i was saying joe . i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents .  if you are a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes ? follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the u.s. is a serious problem .  firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under . i don not understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important . so guns don not kill as many children as car accidents . what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths ? i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control . who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem ? i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends .  more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community . in that sense , i think they might do a little good .  please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good .  my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way . overall , i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful .   i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about 135 , 000 youths are obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge .  i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you will find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily .  well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control . if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths . the cphv reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that 400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year . the cdc estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990 . the cdc also says that 1 . 2 million elementary aged , latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house , have access to guns in their home . california schools reported a 200 increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between 1988 and 1990 . florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 . these are the statistics .    thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger .  holding kids ? time for a reality check , son . these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them . would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did ?  okay , maybe i worded it wrong . dad . i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion . i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die . if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive ? thanks for the reality check joe , its been real .  rodney

3			electronics	patent	circuit	content			 public domain circuits in commercial applications can circuits found in electronics magazines with no patent disclaimer be used legally as subcircuits of a commercial unit ? there are two issues here copyright and patent . the magazine article's contents are copyrighted , and may not be reproduced , translated , etc . without the copyright holder's permission . however , this does not cover the ideas expressed , only the form of expression . copying their circuit diagram or pc board pattern is copyright infringement . but it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted . so long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards , copyright shouldn not be an issue . patents are different . the author does not have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent although it would be sensible for him to do so . in fact , it's possible that he was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it . ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement , although it might reduce the damages a court would award however . unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit , almost certainly it is obvious to one skilled in the art and therefore unpatentable . routine engineering is not patentable ; patents in theory cover only inventions , ideas that are genuinely new . caution i am not a lawyer . consulting a professional would be wise if significant amounts of money are at stake .  all work is one man's work . henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling utzoo ! henry

5			condition	context	verse	logic			 kind , loving , merciful and forgiving god ! 4 so the fact that stephen did not reply to a does not justify the conclusion that stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in a excellent . now under what conditions could such a conclusion be made , other than a direct assertion by his part . replace stephen with david joslin , since you directed the same in t . r . m . robert weiss writes a promise from psalm 9 10 gee , since you wouldn not be at all hypocritical , you must be really busy arguing against these out of context extracted translations ! as you may recall , you mailed me six mail messages quoting articles by robert weiss , all sent within a few minutes of each other . you added naturally , i await your arguments against this out of context translation . but i shall not await holding my breath . and wonder when you get to sleep , disputing all these out of context extracted translations ! and other similar comments . perhaps you could explain why you ever thought that i might have a reason to read all of these articles you pulled off of t . r . m , much less write responses to them ? have you , by chance , ever even heard of inductive logic ? you are not demonstrating any familiarly with it i.e. you are being insufficiently logical . i am familiar with inductive logic . go ahead and give me the details of the logic that led you to conclude , incorrectly , that i would condone robert weiss taking verses out of context . your conclusion was wrong , of course , since i agree that both you and robert weiss were guity of taking verses out of context . nothing hypocritical about that , is there ? since you reached a false conclusion , you made some mistake in your logic . the only question is where . did you think that it would be hypocritical for me not to post a reply to robert weiss articles ? did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of evidence for x with evidence for the lack of x ? is your grasp of inductive logic not quite as firm as you think ? see if you can figure out what your mistake was , and learn from it . dj

4			murder	truth	arm	tank	troop	batf	waco	country	god	compound	fire			 batf fbi murders almost everyone in waco today ! 4 19 i agree that they deserved a trial . they had more than 40 days to come out and get their trial . they chose to keep the children with them and to stay inside . they chose to stay inside even after they were tear gassed . i do not find these actions rational . even noriega was smart enough to give up and go for the trial he deserved .   mr. roby , you are a government sucking heartless bastard  unworthy of comment . but apparently true . my opinion , only , of course .  humans died yesterday , humans who would not have died if the fbi had not taken the actions they did . that is the undeniable truth . i cried for them .  nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty . that is undeniable truth . no , it is not . it is possible the fbi planned for this to happen , and the gunfire heard was the fbi keeping the folks inside . i m not proposing this as the way it went down , but just to point out that it's not undeniable that if they walked out yesterday , they would be alive today . my heart bleeds just as much as yours for the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities to do so . my heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning .  my heart bleeds for no one . you are the bleeding heart . and i m sure beyond any possible doubt that you do not feel for those people as i do . you can not say the heartless things you have said if you did . you seem to say they got what they deserved .  i do not think this . however , if they did set the fire which started in more than one place and spread very quickly , then they got what they wanted and put into motion themselves . they got what they wanted . what kind of creature are you that you can believe this ?  i see the batf is going to be investigated by the justice dept . and likely by arlen spectre and congress . this is good . they have bungled the affair from the start .  we agree on this . now lets have your god , the fbi , investigated , too . jim      i m always rethinking that . there's never been a day when i haven not rethought that . but i can not do that by myself . bill clinton 6 april 93 if i were an american , as i am an englishman , while a foreign troop was landed in my country , i never would lay down my arms , never never never ! william pitt , earl of chatham 1708 1778 18 nov . 1777     jim   i m always rethinking that . there's never been a day when i haven not rethought that . but i can not do that by myself . bill clinton 6 april 93 if i were an american , as i am an englishman , while a foreign troop was landed in my country , i never would lay down my arms , never never never ! william pitt , earl of chatham 1708 1778 18 nov . 1777
3			mission	technique	crash	orbit	newspaper	nasa			 japanese moon landing ? a short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention about how the japanese , using what sounded like a gravity assist , had just managed to crash or crash land a package on the moon .  their hiten engineering test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric earth orbit doing lunar flybys , and then was inserted into lunar orbit using some very tricky gravity assist like maneuvering . this meant that it would crash on the moon eventually , since there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit as far as anyone knows , and i believe i recall hearing recently that it was about to happen . the gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions . these are described by the inventor as exploiting the second order perturbations in a three body system . the probe was launched into this region for the earth moon sun system , where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down . the idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel , we will just find the trajectory that makes it possible . the originator of the technique said that nasa wasn not interested , but that japan was because their probe was small and couldn not hold a lot of fuel for deceleration . this from an issue of 'science news or not he planetary report i believe , about 2 months ago ? raymond l . swartz jr .  i read the newspaper today and was amazed that , in 24 hours , five billion people could accomplish so little .

4			contradiction	interpretation	doctor	fire	state	winner			 the state of justice a judge denied gm's new trial motion , even though gm says it has two new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact , not from the fire .  thoughts ?  how can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than unconscious ? their testimony would be a contradiction of the plaintiff's charge and witness that the occupant moved after the impact , indicating he was alive and trying to get out and provoking all sorts of sympathetic gross , burned alive reactions . it's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led to the previous ruling appear .  or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed ? shouldn not that be up to a jury ?  what kind of witnesses ? if we are talking about witnesses who were at the accident , or were otherwise directly involved e.g . paramedics , emergency room doctors , etc . then they should have been used at the first trial . you don not get a new trial because you screwed up and forgot to call all of your witnesses . they are two witnesses who didn not come forth until after the first trial . while it would be tough luck for gm if they new about these witnesses beforehand , imo this constitutes new evidence . if we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new interpretations of the data , note that the loser can always find such witnesses . if this were grounds for a new trial , then the loser could always get a new trial , and keep doing so until the loser becomes a winner and then the other side would come up with new expert witnesses . no , i support rulings that deny new trials on those grounds . brett  there's nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an intellectual conviction . sean o casey in the white plague by frank herbert .
4			sale	agreement			 national sales tax , the movie well , it seems the national sales tax has gotten its very own cnn news logo !  cool . that means we will be seeing it often .  man , i sure am glad that i quit working or taking this seriously in 1990 . if i kept busting my ass , watching time go by , being frustrated , i would be pretty damn mad by now .  i just wish i had the email address of total gumby who was saying that clinton didn not propose a nst .  actually , jerry brown essentially did . and clinton , in his demagogue persona , condemned brown for it in the crucial ny primary last year . however . why don not the republicans get their act together , and say they will support a broad based vat that would have to be visible the vat in canada is visible unlike the invisible vats they have in europe and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give the clintons enough revenue for their health care reform , and force an agreement with the democrats that the top income tax rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could be increased only via a national referendum . why not make use of the clintons to do something worthwhile . shift the tax burden from investment to consumption , and get health care reform , and a frozen low top marginal tax rate all in one fell swoop . gerald

2			pitcher	game	inning	team	run			 gotta a question . . what is the maximum runs allowed before a stopper can get credit for a relief ? i.e. if a stopper comes in with a 5 run lead does he getcredit with the save . if you come in and pitch the last three innings , and your team was ahead when you got out there and wins the game , you get a save . sort a correct . if you pitched at least 3 innings , entered with your team in the lead , was the pitcher when the game ended , the game was never tied during your stint , and your team won , you get a save . well , the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer , you must have pitched effectively for your 3 innings this save is not automatic , unlike the others . someone in sabr actually looked at these games a few years ago and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one of the games even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly allowing 4 or 5 runs . seeing , hearing my two sense worth john rickert
2			building	puck	hockey	sale	team	minority	state	offer			 for sale ; edmonton oilers .  he was already offered $ 65 million for them from northlands coliseum but refused the offer . i don not think he is going to sale . i think he may decide to move the team to the states though where he can draw more revenue from the team .  pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office , in northlands , and in the business community that the oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey revenues and expenses . that he did this was a good thing . it is better he complain early , and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars . which would truly jeopardize the franchise . pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move , but to sell a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value of the team and to get a better arena deal , either in northlands , or via a new building . pocklington probably isn not going to get exactly what he wants . but ultimately he will probably get enough , or will sell to someone who will probably get enough . there are a lot of risks in moving a team also . . one has to remember peter puck's principle . it is better to spend other people's money than one's own if at all possible . gerald
5			perspective	right	religion	faith	god	technology			 technology i am fairly new to this group . i was wondering about people's opinions on ethical uses of the net , and of technology in general . the classic references in this area are jacques ellul for a liberal evangelical perspective and os guiness for a straight evangelical view . if you want to look at non christian sources try alvin toffler as the perennial optimist his views while blatently non christian explore where technology may be going . for example , there are some chain letters going around which claim to have been written by a christian missionary , but which present a misleading image of the christian religion . this is regardless of technology . be careful to separate the issues of related to speed and dispersion of technology how far the letter went and how quickly it got there and the message being passed in the technology something that seems to be totally wrong . how can we help to make best use of computer technology ? when lecturing in this area i challenge my non christan atheistic class about the impact technology has on life , quality of life and the rights that they consider important . depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology . for example friends of mine are considering ivf due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through ; when it is over they will have the baby . god willing . in this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do . in all cases though you must decide if the technology is against god's revealed word regards david  david morgan university of technology sydney po box 123 broadway nsw 2007 ph 61 2 330 1864 15 73 broadway sydney fax 61 2 330 1807 . i paid good money to get my opinions ; you get them for free v
3			state	management	understanding	nasa	mission	astronaut	space	bus	mechanism	tank	hst	orbit			 space manuevering tug was hst servicing mission   my data shows that the oms engines hold 10 , 900 kg of propellant . of that , a substantial fraction is going to be used for the first oms burn , the reentry burn and the reserve . so pat , tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take , and how much the edo pallet , bus 1 and extra parts are going mass . if you can make the numbers work out , then i will be interested . after you show us that it can be done , then tell us how much the edo pallet , bus 1 and extra equipment is going to cost  i don not know . does anyone in nasa land know how much fuel is budgeted for the altitude change ? henry , any figures on the mass full for the edo pallet plus it's dry weight ? how about for the dry mass of bus 1 ? it was being de classified as i checked last also , i need . 1 current orbital parameters of hst 2 projected orbital parameters after re boost 3 discovery's dry weight 4 hst's dry weight . i somehow think they could train up a new eva in 8 months .  first , while astronauts certainly have done evas with minimal planning , that was because they had to . they don not like to do that as a general rule .  so how long do they need to train ? a year ? 2 years ? somehow i think 2 3 moths should be adequate . second , remember why they had to improvise during intelsat 6 ? they were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn not designed to do that . trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely .  also because they significantly lacked on orbit eva experience . the hst is designed for on orbit servicing . it should be a lot easier . third , they don not have eight months . they have however much time is left after someone comes up with a plan , shows it can work and gets it approved . you may think i have a pessimistic attitude . i think it's realistic . i m not saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are . what i m saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under nasa management .  there comes a time in every project , to kill the management . they can if neccessary , re schedule the hst mission . december is not a drop dead date , unlike say the ldef retrieval mission .  all they have to do is soup it up ? just what does that mean ?  i suspect , the bus 1 , may not have enough basic thrust for the hst re boost it mayu need bigger tanks , or bigger thrusters . my understanding is the second hst servicing mission is not a contingency . my understanding is the mission needs both a new foc and work on the electrical system , plus another re boost  if the smt can avoid a second servicing mission that's $ 500 million saved .  no pat . that's $ 500 million minus the cost of the new hardware , minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along , minus development and mangement costs , minus extra operating costs . tanstaafl .  somehow , i think the cost of an expendable smt will be less then $ 500 million . and the extra stuff is real cheap . nasa has lots of suits , mmu's , and the edo pallets are re usable . oh , one double magnum of champagne , now there's a couple hundred bucks .   pat , not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's made to perform this task , it also ignores the point . there is a desire to have astronauts available so that if the door fails to open , something can be done about it . unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door , you haven not solved the problem . that door has cycled , x times already . once after massive g loading . i somehow think they can work ou ; reliability methods to ensure the door works . also , please tell me how some sort of sublimated material like co2 , or h2o would manage to contaminate the mirror , anything that goes to vapor state , shouldn not adhere to the mirror . somehow , the door , problem can be worked . maybe they can put a one time spring on it . what do they do now , if the door hangs up . that door is part of a intrument safing mechanism . if it hangs up tomorrow , it will be 8 months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it . pat

4			assault	mr.	army	jay	country	bosnia	state	morris	troop			 europe vs . muslim bosnians  i like what mr. joseph biden had to say yesterday 5 11 93 in the senate . condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans and calling that moral rape .   it is easy for sen . biden to say that when there are no us troops in zepa or srebinica or sarejevo . this is true . the existing un policy may certaining be wrong , but the us wants to dictate policy , and make europe responsible for the consequences of that policy . this has merit but is not entirely true . . bosnia is a big enough problem for the us to preach about what other countries should be doing with their forces . but its forces are safely tucked away at home in the us .  gerald  this last statement is not true . according to the cbo the united states has a force of about 88 , 000 us army personel in europe , i do not know if this includes a usmc division in norway . they have available a little more than 500 usaf attack aircraft , including various models of the f 111 , a 10 , f 19a b , and a few f 4s . there are about 1 , 000 more of these available , safely tucked away at home . at one time , the us maintained 1500 mbts about half were m1a1 but some of these were relocated to the persian gulf . i know the us has at least one aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault brigade . does anyone know if there are any b 52 b 1bs in england ? the point is , although there are no us ground troops in bosnia , it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped outside of st louis . i also understand that the administration is planning to position troops in macedonia . any reaction out there to this ? question day before yesterday i heard that serbia & montenegro had imposed additional trade sanctions against the bosnian serb rebels . this morning a npr reported at a bridge on the drina sp ? verified that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to bosnia . a serbian who happened to be muslim , stated that just a few months ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station . now everyone is stopped and searched , many are turned back . of course all i heard was a translators version , i do not speak serbo croatian . if this is a effort on the part of serbia & montenegro for whatever reason to push the boserbs into accepting the v o , is this not a good thing ? peace , jay morris
2			street	dod	ride	bike			 need advice for riding with someone on pillion advice , pillion , help ! a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger there's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power , having taken passengers very occasionally on the small 125 etc bikes i used to ride in the uk it was hard ! i m now riding a gs1100 and that's great , even moving from my freinds gsx600 i was riding recently . this may be due in part to the fact that neither i , nor my regular passengers , are particularly slimline ! i always tell passengers , stay in line with the bike on corners , that makes their movements predictable . my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all , i don not really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods . again that may be biased by the fact that i have had a couple of new passengers a friend recently for her first time on a bike who hold on to me real tight , making any kind of maneuvering difficult . i have also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a bit . i recently took a work collegue to a meeting about a 1 hour ride and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore back . we have a code system for turns , stop and for i need to shift position .  chris seabrook , fujitsu open systems solutions inc phone 1 510 652 6200x118 6121 hollis street , emeryville , ca 94608 2092 , usa fax 1 510 652 5532 dod 0861 per saltire gules and or , a sun counterchanged .
5			faith	logic	doctrine	scripture	love	arm	spirit	passage	church	christ	god	gift			 deuterocanonicals , esp . sirach dave davis ii . the deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they are not quoted by the nt authors . that is not quite accurate . otherwise we would have the book of enoch in the canon as dave noted . one can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by christ iii . the deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the uncontroverted parts of the canon .  then i answer these is a logically invalid a priori . besides , we are talking about ot texts which in many parts are superceded by the nt in the xtian view . would not this same principle exclude ecclesiastes ? this principle cannot be consistently applied .  i have to reject your argument here . the spirit speaks with one voice , and he does not contradict himself . the ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the spirit , i.e . god breathed . it is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic . the early church decided that the apocrypha did not meet this test even though some books such as the wisdom of ben sirach have their uses . for example , the lutheran hymn now thank we all our god quotes a passage from this book . the deutero canonical books were added much later in the church's history . they do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of scripture . i do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the spirit in so doing . and that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends . david h . wagner a confessional lutheran now thank we all our god with heart and hands and voices , who wondrous things hath done , in whom his world rejoices ; who from our mother's arms hath blessed us on our way with countless gifts of love , and still is our today . nun danket alle gott , v . 1 martin rinckart , 1636 compare ben sirach 50 22 24

5			atheism	god	faith	existence	belief	theist	theism	atheist	logic			 radical agnostic . not ! reply to e . h . welbon  there is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt that a god does not exist but if anyone has one , by all means , tell me what it is . therefore , lacking this ability of absolute proof , being an atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself , and this i cannot accept . i accept nothing on blind faith .  invisible pink flying unicorns ! need i say more ?  . i harbor no beliefs at all , there is no good evidence for god existing or not . some folks call this agnosticism . it does not suffer from blind faith at all . i think of it as don not worry , be happy .  for many atheists , the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing ? there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods , nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith . faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence . it is a reliable way of knowing ?  there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof . even when we agree to take someone elses word on faith , we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past , we judge him likely to be a reliable source now . if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else , why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods ?  the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing , rather than , as some agnostic posters would have it , whether ones faith is in gods or no gods . the theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods , even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times , for example in his work as a scientist the atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge . agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism , unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge . without evidence , why should we believe in gods rather than santa claus or the easter bunny ?  i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn not require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods . i don not believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge . atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the lack of facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found .  david nye . midelfort clinic , eau claire wi this is patently absurd ; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities . bertrand russell

1			directory	window	hundred	session	windows	ibm	screen	file	context			 tcp ip through windows 3 . 1 i don not know much about computers , so please bear with me . here's my question context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe an ibm 3090 running vms mvs , and log on to my account . when i installed slip on my computer , i had to configure it for my modem 14 . 4 kbs etronics internal and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe . the way it works now is that i type telnet uicvm or tn3270 uicvm either will work at the dos prompt . uicvm is the node name of the mainframe . the program then dials the mainframe , establishes a protocol , and gives me the logon screen . telnet and tn3270 are the names of batch files in my slip directory . i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session . problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows 3 . 1 because i hardly ever use dos directly . slip will not run under windows . i talked to the people at our computer center , and they suggested that i use a packet driver called winpkt . com with slip . they gave me instructions on how to load it before i start windows , and how to modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files in the slip directory to ensure that it would work . i did all that and i could run slip from windows , but there were other problems. for one thing , slip would not hang up the phone when i exited . i had to run my communi cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn not work . for another , there were too many errors . it often took me 3 4 tries to connect to the mainframe . our computer center does not support slip under windows , so i can not keep going back to them with more questions . question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows and do what slip is supposed to do ? i need a package that is not too expensive , which is why i am looking for shareware . i have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this , but they cost hundreds of dollars . these are the main requirements 1 . must be able to run under windows 3 . 1 2 . must allow vt100 and ibm tn3270 terminal emulation 3 . must allow ftp file transfers , since that's the only kind the mainframe allows . no y modem or z modem etc. i believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol , but i m hazy about that . a subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if it's a true windows program rather than a dos program modified to run under windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications . any information received is appreciated . pankaj saxena

1			server	export	right	screen			 blinking cursor in xterm ?  oh boy have i wanted this too . however , i believe that the cursor will be under the server's control could be wrong ? on an xterminal , for example , if the server was not the one controlling the cursor , then trying to get the xterm application to do the blinking would cause needless and yucky network overhead consistantly .  most people who write cursor blinking code just implement the simple case a straight 500msec or so on off cycle . however , the cursor will work much better if cursor blinking is suppressed i.e. the cursor is made visible any time the cursor moves and for . 5 to 1 sec thereafter . if you don not do this , the cursor will be hard to track when in motion . you allways could port and use emu from export . lcs . mit . edu contrib emu . tar . z . we have implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned . you can even configure the actual size of the text cursor horizontal ver tical line cursors , smaller block cursors , turn on and off blinking , set the blink rate and so on . you even get blinking text ok , enough advertising . i haven not looked at the xterm code in this respect , but from the memories i have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted mostly the blinking text , i would say it won not be easy , since xterm is a hairy mess understandable if you follow it's roots back to x10 . the actual task to get the cursor to blink isn not that difficult if you provide the right hooks . as antonio mentioned , you will have to show the cursor directly after it has moved , or people will become confused . since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways , this isn not very complicated . you will just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped . as for the portability of emu and it's newest version . the one on export is still the same as on the r5 contrib tape . we wanted to get out a new release for over six months now , but unfortunately we are drowning in work . but since the changes aren not affectiong emu's behavior much , i would say whoever wants to try emu shouldn not wait for a new version . as is , emu won not work on bsd derived systems e.g. suns with anything else than a csh . there is a fix to this , which is very short remove one line of code . i will put this on export today . michael  michael elbel , digital pcs gmbh , muenchen , germany intelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer doofe mia fermentation fault coors dumped

4			assault	right	newspaper	firearm	price	citizen	amendment	rifle	sport	arm	gun			 newspapers censoring gun advertisements originator recently while looking around in traders sporting goods store , a very well stocked firearms store , i discovered a printed document that was being distributed by the good folks who work there . traders , btw , is located in san leandro , ca . . . . the newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads which is why you no longer see the ads that traders , san leandro , has run for many years .  these ads were run for the law abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self protection . they certainly have the right to do so , under the second amendment right to bear arms.  are you sure about this ? i m currently looking at a copy of last thursday's sf chronicle and there is the typical one column traders ad on page c7 in the sports section . not only that , but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says wanted we pay cash for assault rifles and pistols . granted , i haven not seen today's paper yet . but i would be surprised if there wasn not a traders ad in it . it's probably worth it to write to the chronicle and other papers anyway , because all their anti gun editorials are disgusting . by the way , let me put in a plug for traders . i have shopped all over the sf bay area and i have never seen another store with lower prices . and their selection is amazing .  lee gaucher my opinions . no one else's .

4			war	bullet	adam	bank	right	incident	officer			 israeli destruction of mosque s in jerusalem i am not aware of any such incidents . i have asked you to document your accusation . i repeat my request , nay , demand , that you either substantiate your accusation or else desist from spewing more baseless eggert blabber .   i have read most of the history books dealing with this period , good and bad , and while it is possible that i missed one or two , none of those i have read documents any razing of mosques . so i think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation .  jake disrespectfully demands , and adam requires specific documentation of the razing of mosques in jerusalem . if either of them had been reading t . p . m for a while , they would already have seen such documentation . for the forgetful or newcomers , however , here are the references . well , i have been reading t . pm for a while and here is what i saw you write for balance , perhaps you should mention the mosques in jerusalem that were razed after the israeli victory in 1967 . an eye for an eye , i guess . your statment clearly tries to balance arab atrocities by noting a single incident by the israelis in war time at their most holy site . you even characterize it as an eye for an eye . that would be false . if you read your history , you will learn that right after the 1967 war , the victorious israelis decided to raze a section of the newly captured east jerusalem , near the wailing wall . it is in this section that mosques were razed . so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque was razed . you then followed it with this episode is an example of a good government running amok with newly acquired power . really ? do you still feel that israelis are comparable in the running amok with power with , say , the iraqis ? your eye for an eye comparisons don not match the realities that most of us are familiar with . quoting from the west bank story , pages 35 36 on the night of june 10 , an israeli officer marched from door to door this happened to be during a war ! and a fierce and mighty war it was , too . would you say that the jordanians indiscriminately shot up ancient structures as is their custom in describing bullet holes in the walls of the city ? this was war ! it was certainly not any eye for an eye characterstic . israelis do not harbor the same feelings of revenge as the arabs generally do . this is one of the reasons that the peace now movement exists in israel and nowhere else in the m . e .  jake livni ten years from now , george bush will american occupied new york have replaced jimmy carter as the my opinions only employer has no opinions . standard of a failed president .

1			swap	james	file	microsoft	space	windows	explanation			 permanaent swap file with dos 6 . 0 dbldisk explanation of message stuff deleted  more on permenent swap files .  i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size . windows will only use the size suggested . do you wan not to create this swap file anyway or something like that .  well , a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why . what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2 . then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space . windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers .  they also said that under absolutely no circumstances . none ! will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size . well . that's what he said !  i call bull $ . if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it ?  any takers ?  james well , someone at microsoft told you wrong . windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size . last summer i went to a microsoft windows 3 . 1 technical workshop and they distributed a lot of information that the general public might not be aware of . anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on creating larger than recommended swapfile . i will quote the information if you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size , you will receive a message telling you that windows will not use anything larger than the recommended size . this error message is incorrect , we will allow the use of the larger swapfile , up to four times the amount of ram on your machine . so as you see , microsoft does know that the information is incorrect . you probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew . be that what it may , i would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these technical workshops . they aren not actually incredibly in depth , but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know . besides that they offer you huge discounts on software . if i remember correctly , you could pick up word 2 . 0 , excel 4 . 0 , or whatever their presentation program is for $ 130 . that is the full blown version , not an upgrade or educational version . you could also pick up microsoft office for $ 500 or something like that . myself i sprang for word well , hope that was helpful to someone . and besides that i hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money . and if anyone at microsoft is reading this i really love your products . i need a job once i graduate also , can we work something out ? thanks , brent casavant

4			state	troop	gun	officer	church	citizen	guard	police	right	tank	batf	abuse	education			 welcome to police state usa   any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare a private state has drifted into anarchy . there are laws to control the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that they were being violated . they set out to obtain a legal warrant and attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang the doorbell .  the batf , in a letter they have been sending out to people , says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise , and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their faces .  it strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to serve a warrant by knocking on the door .  presumably the b d did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell . let's try that again why was the batf concerned about surprise when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door ? the batf appears to be inconsistant in their own description of events . and in any case , how does one mount an ambush if one isn not on alert ? had they expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day one .  phill , the batf were in a firefight with the bd for forty five minutes . i find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful citizens they wouldn not have shown up in live stock trailers and would have retreated immediately .  not a smart move . unless meant to be part of the surprize cover . even so the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea . a side opening truck would have been much better , more like a covered waggon . so , were the batf fired on before or after they left the trailers to knock on the door to serve the warrant ? every description i have heard indicates the batf did not hang around in the trailers once they decided to open them up . for that matter , if they expect peaceful citizens , why come in live stock trailers to being with ? if they were expecting peacful citizens , why show up with over a hundred officers , some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying sub machineguns , and 3 national guard helicopters ?  sounds just about right to me . its the minimum amount of force that i would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk . politics . guns annual dinner . ok , just to make sure we have got this straight you consider armed troops in disguised vehicles and multiple helicopters to be used to serve search warrants on peaceful citizens . and just so we don not have one of those entertaining shifts , you described them as the batf expecting them to be , peaceful . michael hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including members of the parachute regiment to remove approx 250 hippy peace protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles . he even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings . just about the most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener . that single action probably cost him the position as prime minister . one of the elders of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of toryism . hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke . i don not see how past abuses excuse present ones . hell , you are not even discussing the same government .  david veal univ . of tenn . div . of cont . education info . services group i still remember the way you laughed , the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft ; i m beginning to think you don not love me anymore . weird al

2			game	russian	team	nhl	fan	wing	season	league	hockey	player			 too many europeans in nhl nntp posting user euatno ten years ago , the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter of what it is now . going into the 1992 93 season , the numbers of euros on nhl teams have escalated to the following stats canadians 400 americans 100 europeans 100 please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun . here's the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl . i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian team let's say , the red wings and the canucks and seeing names like bure konstantinov and borshevshky . is this north america or isn not it ? toronto , detriot , quebec , and edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of euros on other teams is getting worse as well . is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians ? i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure , the russian rocket i will completely throw up . as it is now , every time i see the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross check bure into the plexiglass so hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher . by the way , i m not a canucks fan to begin with ; okay , the stretcher remark was a little carried away . but the point is that i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians and some americans . it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their north american league and instead gives it to europeans , who aren not even better hockey players . it's all hype . this european mystique is sickening , but until nhl owners get over it , canadian and american players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league . with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating , the problem is clearly only getting worse . and where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans ? dont say that the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game . i mean , look at the way you play these days . less fights and more hockey . imho , canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the 70's when the game was more brute than beauty . i m all for the creation of a european hockey league , and let the bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent . oh , look ! you don not like finns either . i just don not want them on mine . too bad almost all of you northamericans originates from europe . hmmm . and what kind of a name is rauser . doesn not sound very canadian to me . ps . when analyzing teams like italy , france and great britain you find that a lot of their players are canadians with double citizenship . ds    richard j . rauser you have no idea what you are doing . oh , don not worry about that . we are professional wni outlaws we do this for a living .  remember , no matter where you go , there you are . dr.banzai  , l l   tomas nopp tel 46 8 727 33 24 ellemtel telecom systems labs fax 46 8 647 80 59 box 1505 email s 125 25 alvsjo snailmail

3						 can radio freq . be used to measure distance ? i m wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver ?  seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance . this would be for short distances 2000 ft , and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so .  you might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. they work best for close work 1 mile and under . rf is used for much longer distances in two major modes . transponder and phase measurment . transponder requires you send a pulse to another station and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the receiver time . phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the same frequency signal multiplexed in time . a receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signals . maps can be drawn that plot the stations . john eaton ! hp vcd ! johne

1			understanding	server	client	file	directory	windows	management			 virtual reality for x on the cheap ! hi everyone , i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse 1 . 0 . 2 multiverse is a multi user , non immersive , x windows based virtual reality system , primarily focused on entertainment research . features client server based model , using berkeley sockets . no limit to the number of users apart from performance . generic clients . customizable servers . hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources . multiple light sources ambient , point and spot . objects can have extension code , to handle unique functionality , easily attached . functionality client the client is built around a fast render loop . basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint . it also provides the server with information about the user's actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users . the client is designed to be generic in other words you don not need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world . this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it . the adaptations , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the servers . this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient , point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn not support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it can not , but because i don not have one ! this will , however , be one of the first enhancements ! server s this is where customization can take place . the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much , but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally . things get more interesting in the object extension functionality . this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world . basically you call the extension initialisers you want . o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to . current events supported init , move , change , collide & terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software . your callback will be activated when a collision occurs . this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose . the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported , plus any initialization you want to do . o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client . o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world . wld file for a new client . o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have . o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild ! at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients . that's all there is to it ! and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i have provided stairs ! will probably be improved with future versions location this software is located at the following site ftp . u . washington . edu directory pub virtual worlds file multiverse 1 . 0 . 2 . tar . z futures client o texture mapping . o more realistic rendering i.e. z buffering or similar , gouraud shading o hmd support . o etc , etc . server o physical modelling gravity , friction etc . o enhanced object management interaction o etc , etc . both o improved comms ! i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software , unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation , and i m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified ! i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i have certainly found fascinating developing it , and i would love to add support for the powerglove . and an hmd ! finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code . by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i , out the kindness of my heart , or you , out of pure desperation , provide . i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own risk ! disclaimer over ! of course if you love it , i would like to here from you . and anyone with positive contributions criticisms is also encouraged to contact me . anyone who hates it dev null !   and if anyone wants to let me do this for a living you know where to write !   thanks , robert .
2			team	peter	morris	brave	chip	cup	pitch	diamond	right	game	score	play			 ron gant , stalling , and hirschbeck . while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around , gant wasn not ordered back in the box sooner , he was ordered back immediately . as soon as he stepped out , hirschbeck told him to get back in the box . now , gant doesn not take a lot of walks between pitches . the only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the call . i expect his concentration wasn not there yet , and in a crucial situation i imagine it's best to be as calm as possible . contributing factors would be gant's bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the braves long scoring drought . and it is not hirschbeck's job to help gant with any of these difficulties . if gant can not gather his concentration for whatever reason , that just makes him all the more meat in the batter's box . the umpire's job is to maintain flow of play . gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties . nor is anyone else . now , it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there . you know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike , throw you out , etc . gant was wrong . absolutely . i think it would be more accurate to say gant was foolish . but hirschbeck was more wrong , in my biased view . aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem . gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call . if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout , games would last about nine fifteen weeks , if jack morris or dave whiner stieb were pitching . a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out . suck it up , get back in the box , and never badmouth the blue . they are not going to change their mind , and you are just going to come across as a pinhead , which won not help you with the borderline calls . ftr i never speak to umpires when i don not know them personally , nor do i glance at them , or react to calls . as a result , i think i get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate , because i have a rep of having a good eye . actually , there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep , including copious questions about my masculinity , party affiliation , and sexual preference . gant hadn not been wasting time all game . the game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old . irrelevant . he was wasting time then . the score was 1 0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position . is there any reason hirschbeck couldn not , and shouldn not , cut gant a little slack ? 1 . because it's not his job . 2 . because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily extend to those 3 hour games . kind of like the phantom dp . for no discernible constructive reason , hirschbeck disrupted the game , caused a five minute delay , and materially hurt the batter in a key situation . did he have a date to get to ? gant hurt himself , and the braves disrupted the game . your biases are exposed , and i m sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants , which is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura , jack kevorkian , and the swedish abortion team . and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game . i believe terry said the magic word there are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a ballgame . for a primer , email me . good ways to get tossed from a game 1 . ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutri system . 2 . kiss rich garcia on the lips , and say hi , honey , i m home ! 3 . goose eric gregg . 4 . ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived . 5 . get naked . source the greg spira book of diamond ettiquette , as told to peter gammons . 1991 , collier press .  gary huckabay outside ? that was right down the bleedin pipe , balder than any kenny ! i realize i don not have great control , but dave on the net . c mon ! gary , that was a styrofoam cup . the really . plate's a foot to your right . throw the ball .

a in the us , currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors . new york prohibits their use in large trucks . in canada , they are illegal in manitoba , ontario , quebec , newfoundland and pei prince edward island . they are apparently are illegal through most , if not all , of europe . legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions ; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal . q where are radar detector detectors used ? do they really work ? a usage is spreading rapidly ; initially they were used only in canada , but now they are appearing in new york and virginia . it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and d . c . they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors ; some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others , and are thus more likely to be spotted . new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors . note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on . q what is vascar ? is it some kind of radar ? a vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time speed distance computer . it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks . no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system . q what is ka band radar ? where is it used ? should a radar detector be able to handle it ? a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in so called photo radar installations . in these installations , a low powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the direction of traffic , and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit . tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle . because of the low power and the 45 degree angle , many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit , although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway . the number of locales where photo radar is in use is limited , and some question the legality of such units . best advice learn what photo radar units look like , and keep track of where they are used or else , don not speed . q do radar jammers work ? are they legal ? a quick answer no , and not in the usa . detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all . jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military . jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa . driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions q what are understeer and oversteer ? a understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion , that is . most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter . simply put , they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less , or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer . understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers , inadvertantly traveling too fast , won not get into trouble . understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner . oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars ; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer , or tto . in extreme cases , lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning . some technical details in a corner at speed , the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles ; the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel . in understeer , the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels . in oversteer , the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels . q what is a rev matched downshift ? a when downshifting , the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear . however , during a downshift , normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle , so the revs drop rather than increase . in rev matched downshift , you blip the throttle before re engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed . this results in a much smoother and faster downshift . q what does heel and toe mean ? a heel and toe is a technique used to do a rev matched downshift while braking . this is normally challenging , because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle . it is called heel and toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake , and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift . in many modern cars this is a misnomer ; often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle . note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch , and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle , accomplishing the same thing . q what is double clutch downshifting ? a while your right foot is doing the above , your left foot can do one of three things nothing , declutch once , or declutch twice . the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine . this is usually coupled with rev matching , so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged , the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up . the procedure is as follows 0 declutch 1 move gearshift lever to neutral 2 engage clutch 3 match revs 4 declutch 5 move gearshift lever to next lower gear 6 engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work , but with practice it becomes natural . the problem that double clutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox . in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros , double clutching makes it much easier to shift . basically , if you double clutch well , you are not using the synchros at all . this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition . q what do the numbers for acceleration from 0 60 , 1 4 mile , skidpad , and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean ? may they be compared ? a in short , 1 not as much as the magazines want you to believe , and 2 almost never . in more detail the acceleration numbers 0 60mph and 1 4 mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source . testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road & track number to a car & driver number is quite pointless . keep in mind , too , that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street ; the driver is a major often the major part of the equation . skidpads vary , and even if they didn not , skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires ; they change radically when tire compounds change . do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of , say , two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers . this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value , however . skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools . they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires . slalom times are slightly more useful ; they test some small parts of the automobile's transient response . however , they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car , and they do not test many corners of the car's envelope . they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision . for example , they don not tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off camber . when a car has an adjustable suspension , these tests are usually done in the sport setting , which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving . the list of caveats could go on for page after page . q my buddy claims that wide tires don not make any difference , according to his freshman physics textbook , and that you can not ever accelerate or corner at more than 1 . 0g . does he know what he's talking about ? a 1 in short he hasn not got a clue . 2 in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth , dry and non deformable , none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature . pavement is never smooth ; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent . tires , which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid , and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic , deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over . in a tire at operating temperature , grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber , and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term . the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature , the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction ; if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature , the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid , which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread , causing characteristic blisters and chunking . this latter , though , is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving , so unless you are a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving , don not worry about it . because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction , it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all ; thus dragsters accelerate at more than 1 . 0g and race cars corner and brake at more than 1 . 0g . because simple friction does not apply , it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip . an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis , due to the complexity of the mechanism . misc . questions q what does name or acronym stand for ? a here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about ; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net . in particular , never ask in rec . humor if you want a useful result . saab svenska aeroplan a . b . or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili , or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino , or the italian automobile manufacturers of turin bmw bayerische motoren werke , or bavarian motor works mg morris garage q does vw own porsche ? a no. porsche is a publicly held company , controlled by the porsche and piech families . porsche has extensive business dealings with vw audi , which causes some confusion . since currently porsche is in some financial difficulty , there is a possibility that mercedes or vw may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future , but this is only speculation at this time .  richard welty 518 393 7228 nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis carroll smith

3			technology	country	facility	defense			 what if the ussr had reached the moon first ? if i read you right , you are saying in essence that , with a larger economy , nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a lunar facility . that was certainly partially the case with apollo , but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military , scientific , or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have the money , why not ? approach .  ah , but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon . it's not like they would be using $ 1000 1000r ? bills to fuel their moon dozers . the money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged . it's a way of funding high tech research , just like darpa was a good excuse to fund various fields of research , under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country , or like esprit is a good excuse for the ec to fund research , under the pretense that it's good for pan european cooperation .  now maybe you think that government funded research is a waste of money in fact , i m pretty sure you do , but it does count as investment spending , which does boost the economy and just look at the size of that multiplier . actually i favor government funded research . it is a pump prime for a lot of basic technologies . i also understand the short term value of high tech welfare programs. but they can not substitute for long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise . that's what's needed to maintain a healthy economy anywhere , on earth or luna . i don not see that long term potential on luna due to a bunch of factors i outline in another post gary  gary coffman ke4zv you make it , gatech ! wa4mei ! ke4zv ! gary destructive testing systems we break it . uunet ! rsiatl ! ke4zv ! gary 534 shannon way guaranteed ! emory ! kd4nc ! ke4zv ! gary lawrenceville , ga 30244

3			space	improvement	technology	resolution	hst	orbit			 space marketing would be wonderfull .   on mon , 17 may 1993 05 48 59 gmt , frank crary said because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer . modern , ground based , visible light astronomy what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field the ahh , perhaps that's why we have astronomers have just built 2 10 meter ground based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones . fc exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big , fc visable light telescopes ? from what i have seen , 10 or less fc down from amlost 100 25 years ago . that sounds like dying fc to me . that doesn not seem like a fair comparison . infrared astronomy didn not really get started until something like 25 yrs . ago ; it didn not explode until iras in 1983 . gamma ray and i think x ray observations didn not really get started until the 70s . i believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in general , and i know that extreme uv short of 1000 angstroms observations , until the euve launched last year had almost no history except a few observations on skylab in the 70s . twenty five years ago , the vast majority of astronomers only had access to optical or radio instruments . now , with far more instruments available , growth in some of these new fields has resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of total astronomical work . seriously , though , you are never going to get a 10 meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground , and with adaptive optics and a good site , the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway . fc that would be true , if adaptive optics worked well in the visable . fc but take a look at the papers on the subject they refer to anything fc up to 100 microns as visable . i don not know about you , but most fc people have trouble seeing beyond 7 microns or so . there are fc reasons to think adaptive optics will not work at shorter fc wavelengths without truely radical improvements in technology . hmm , some of the folks in this department planning on using adaptive optics at the 5 m at palomar for near infrared observations 1 and 2 microns might be surprised to hear this . and isn not the ntt already pushing toward 0 . 1 arcsecond resolution , from a ground based site remember 0 . 1 arcseconds was one of the selling points of hst .  email t . joseph lazio phone 607 255 6420 icbm 42 deg . 20 08 n 76 deg . 28 48 w cornell knows i exist ? ! stop rape

3			yeast	medicine	infection			 can men get yeast infections ?  well folks , i currently have a yeast infection . i am male . . your best bet or at least your husband's is to treat and cure your infection before any intercourse . if you must , use a condom . also , consider other forms of sexual release ie . handjobs until you are cured . though i can not imagine wanting to have intercourse during a full blown yeast infection chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite low , especially if he's circumcised . but it can happen . at one point i was getting recurrent yeast infections and the dr suspected my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me . the prescription was interesting . for each day of the medication a week i was to insert the medication , then to have intercourse . the resulting action would help the medicine be spread around in me better , and would simultaneously treat him .

4			citizen	belief	state	town	relationship	crime	church			 sexual proposition sexual harassment ?  dale cook said  a real world data point a person has a much stronger legal claim for harrassment sexual or otherwise if they make it clear to the offender that their behaviour is unwanted . if the behaviour persists , harrassment is much easier to demonstrate , due to the fact that the offender knew that the behaviour was unwanted .  no argument here . my original query regarded the question of why the first sexual proposition made by person a to person b would be considered to be sexual harassment by some many people . assuming , of course , that there does not exist a power relationship between a and b such that the proposition carries strong implications of extortion right from word one . i can only say that those people are wrong . the word harass means to irritate or torment persistently ; i would hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent . additionally , there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted , unlike an illegal proposition .  of course , i think the original question of offering money for sex is inarguably harrassment , because the activity is illegal , and could be presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen .  i have to take issue with this viewpoint . given that a prostitution is a victimless crime and b there are literally millions of americans who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state has defined to be criminal e.g . prostitution , obscenity , gambling , using certain recreational drugs , having non mercenary sex with persons not one's spouse in certain states , having unnatural sex with people regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states , etc . i would have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight face . he said , speaking as a law student who's read his share of judicial opinions in which reality was not only denied but , in fact , actually inverted in order to make the universe conform to the writer's politics . i was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint . what you say is true , but the law , in order to make what little sense it manages to make , has to make some assumptions . assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen i think is reasonable . certainly , i would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome . the number of people who participate in victimless crimes notwithstanding , the fact reamins that under the law , the activity is illegal . to presume that the proposition is welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face .  . dale cook any town having more churches than bars has a serious social problem . edward abbey the opinions are mine only i.e . they are not my employer's

the magi of matthew was the jewish discomfort with jesus since everywhere i look , zoroaster is suggested as being a probable descendant of daniel ; suppose you prove he wasn not . ref encyclopedia of religion , mircea eliade magi sneak preview later still , eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo christian religions , as can be seen in the famous oracles of hystaspes , a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era , probably the second century ce widengren , 1968 . the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew 2 1 12 . the old persian word magu , rendered in greek by magos , is of uncertain etymology . it may originally have meant member of the tribe , as in the avestan compound mogu tbish hostile to a member of the tribe . this meaning would have been further resticted , among the medes , to member of the priestly tribe and perhaps to priest benveniste , 1938 ; boyce , 1982 . the term is probably of median origin , given that herodotus mentions the magoi as one of the six tribes of the medes . for a variety of reasons we can consider the magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of median origin in western iran . among the persians , they were responsible for liturgical functions , as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult . most likely , the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran became established during the time of the median monarchy that dominated the persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great 550 bce . the persians were indebted to the medes for their political and civil institutions as well . even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyce , 1982 , we must still maintain that they were of median origin . this is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian , mentioned by darius i 522 486 bce in the inscription at bisutun iran , as well as by greek sources . indeed , herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persians through the conspiracy of the magi . the fact that the magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions . this seems to be attested by the elamite tablets at persepolis . there is a theses , put forth by giuseppe messina , that denies that the magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin . this thesis is untenable ; on the other hand , the hypothesis that their name is related to the avestan term magavan , derived from the gathic maga vedic , magha , gift , is not without foundation mole , 1963 . the meaning of maga can probably be found , in conformity with the pahlavi tradition , within the context of the concept of purity , or separation of the mixture of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter . the maga , which has been erroneously interpreted as chorus , from the root mangh , which is said to mean sing the magic song nyberg , 1966 and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica , seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision . in any case , though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan terms magavan and maga , we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood . the avesta ignores the median or old persian term , despite a recent hypothesis proposed by h . w . bailey ; old persian inscriptions ignore the avestan term for priest , athravan vedic , athravan , even if this is perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablets of persepolis gershevitch , 1964 . the term magu has been present in zoroastrianism throughout its history ; the pahlavi terms mogh mard and mobad represent its continuation . the latter in particular derives from an older form , magupati head of the magi . during the sasanid period third to seventh centuries ce , which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church , the title mobadan mobad the high priest of high priests came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy . the magi practiced consanguineous marriage , or khvaetvadatha av . pahl . khwedodah . they also performed a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it . the corpse was not supposed to decompose , lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction . this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsis in india . stone towers , known as dakhmas , were built especially for this rite . during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the magi ; the persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax , then buried it . the practice was widespread , however , among the peoples of central asia . the magi were the technicians of and experts on worship it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a magus . during the performance of a ritual sacrifice , the magus sang of the theogony the magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry , but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the avesta and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future . the magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful , or ahrimanical , animals khrafstra such as snakes and ants . they dressed in the median style , wearing pants , tunics , and coats with sleeves . they wore a characteristic head covering of felt gr . tiara with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath boyce , 1982 . the color of these caps , in conformity with a tradition that is probably of indo european origin , according to georges dumezil , was that of the priesthood white . in all likelihood , during the achaemenid period the magi were not in possession of a well defined body of doctrine , and it is probable that they gradually adopted zoroastrianism ; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism . nonetheless , they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of zorastrian traditions . by virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes . the wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the magic of zarathushtra , son of horomazes and thus the cult of the gods . magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just , courageous , and master of himself . during the achaemenid period the magi maintained a position of great influence , although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor . despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of gaumata the magian in which , according to herodotus who calls himself smerdis , the persians killed a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in media , in persia , and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration . no priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the magi . they were renowned as followers of zarathushtra zoroaster ; as the teachers of some of the greatest greek thinkers pythagoras , democritus , plato ; as the wise men who arrived , guided by a star , at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem ; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in india . but they were also known as the chaldeans , the priesthood of babylon , known for its occultism ; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in greek , like goes , expert in the magic arts bidez and cumont , 1938 . indeed , the chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts , especially astrology , and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge . to understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views , it is necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so called western magi , who were later hellenized . in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian , but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor , syria , mesopotamia , and armenia , who came in contact with diverse religious traditions , must have , sooner or later and in varying degrees , been influenced by syncretic concepts . the greeks were familiar with both kinds of magi and , depending on their varying concerns , would emphasize one or the other aspect of them . classical historians and geographers , including herodotus and strabo , document their customs , while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines dualism , belief in the hereafter , magian cosmology and cosmogony , and their theology and eschatology . those sources most interested in the doctrines of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magus . in doing so they are repeating what the magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid periods , when they adopted zoroastrianism . at that time they embraced zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name . zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die . it has been said quite often , in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition , that the vendidad from vi daevo data , the law abjuring daivas , part of the avesta , should be attributed to them . this collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices . nonetheless , the hypothesis is hardly plausible , since the first chapter of the vendidad a list of sixteen lands created by ahura mazda , the supreme god of zoroastrianism , but contaminated by an attack by ahriman pahl . gathic avestan , angra mainyu , the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering does not mention western iran , persia , or media the land of ragha mentioned in the text cannot be median raghiana . furthermore , it has been noted gershevitch , 1964 that if the authors had been magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institutions , including their own priesthood , would be very strange . the magi were above all the means by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have been transmitted to us , from the second half of the first millennium bce on . this has been their principal merit . we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assumed , known to us especially from greek sources and , in part , from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries ce . according to this formulation , the two poles of the dualism are no longer , as in the gathas , spenta mainyu beneficent spirit and angra mainyu hostile spirit but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch , 1964 . see ahura mazda and angra mainyu . this trans formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious world . in this new dualism which was that later known to the greeks aristotle , eudemus of rhodes , theopompus , and others we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism , to which we give the name zurvanism . see zurvanism . thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism , the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtra's treachings , as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically . their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the iranian diaspora . the greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them xanthus of lydia , hermodorus , aristotle , theopompus , hermippus , dinon , even writing treatises on the persian religion , of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived . in the hellenistic period , the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom , and writings on magic , astrology , and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as zarathushtra , ostanes , and hystaspes , forming an abundant apocryphal literature . bidez and cumont , 1938 . later still , eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo christian religions , as can be seen in the famous oracles of hystaspes , a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era , probably the second century ce widengren , 1968 . the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew 2 1 12 . see saoshyant . the sasanid period saw the magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of iran . concerned to win back the western magi de menasce , 1956 , and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism as the national religion of iran , the priests of iranian sanctuaries in media and persia were able to establish a true state church , strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures . the leading figures in the development of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxy were tosar and kerder , the persecutors of mani in the third century . saoshyant the avestan term saoshyant future benefactor ; mpers . soshans designates the savior of the world , who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind . the concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of zoro astrianism , together with that of dualism ; it appears as early as in the gathas . zarathushtra zoroaster , as the prophet of the religion , is himself a sao shyant , one who performs his works for the frashokereti , the end of the present state of the world , when existence will be rehabilitated and made splendid . see frashokereti later zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of saoshyants from one to three . all the saviors are born from the seed of zarathushtra , which is preserved through the ages in lake kansaoya identified with present day lake helmand , in seistan , iran , protected by 99 , 999 fravashis , or guardian spirits . the greatest of the awaited saoshyants , the victorious astvatereta he who embodies truth , the son of the vispataurvairi she who conquers all , is the third , who will make existence splendid ; he appears in yashts 19 . upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age , death , or corruption , and will be granted unlimited power . at that time the dead will be resurrected , and the living will be immortal and indestructable . brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth that is , the world of the spirit , and of asha , astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable . he and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil , which will be destroyed . the name astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation kellens , 1974 , as are those of his two brothers , ukhshyatereta , he who makes truth grow , and ukhshyatnemah , he who makes reverence grow ; the names of the three virgins yashts 13 who are impregnated with the seed of zarathushtra when they bathe in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants , are equally speculative . each of these saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium , initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence ; astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind . the doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the archaemenid period sixth to fourth century bce . it was not , perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea , but it was certainly a determining factor , one that enjoyed great success in the hellenistic period beyond the confines of the iranian world . a similar concept , that of the future buddha , maitreya , was most likely indebted to it , and christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source .

2			paul	pen	run	team	defense	series	season	key	pitcher	league	morris	baseball			 pleasant yankee surprises  some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 1993 edition of the bronx bombers so far .  first , the pleasant  1 spike owen . all through spring training , this guy was looking like the second coming of mike gallego , but with even worse hitting . now the guy is third in the major leagues in ba , and he's ranked pretty high in total hits and runs scored . i know it's still early in the season , but he and pat kelly more on him in a minute have provided a lot of spark at the bottom of the order that's given the big guys mattingly , tartabull , o neill plenty of rbi opportunities . let's hope he keeps this up .  2 pat kelly . the guy is finally showing some of the ability that led stick michael to label him a star for the 90s . i wouldn not go that far , but kelly looks infinitely improved at bat i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training really paid off . huh ! and here i thought boggs would never do anything to help anybody besides himself ! and his glove , like always , has been terrific he and mattingly comprise the best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho .  3 paul o neill . we had to get rid of roberto kelly , partly because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next barry bonds he won not do that in cincy , either , and partly because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up in the second half of the year . i just felt that we could have gotten more for him than o neill . well , so far , o neill is turning out just fine . he looks like he should be able to duplicate if not surpass mel hall's numbers from last year , and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull . now , if only buck would play him against lefties some more to see what he can do !  4 wickman . a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack morris they never have impressive stats but they always find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that ability . i figured that wickman would be the least important part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth guy , maybe winding up as a good middle reliever . but i like what i have seen so far . he doesn not pitch pretty , but he gets the job done .  5 key . what's going on here ? key was just supposed to provide the rotation with some stability you know , shore up the left side , provide experience , get maybe 15 wins , and here this guy is dominating everybody he faces ! who needs maddux or cone 0 2 ? i will take key any day .  and now , the not so pleasant surprises  1 spike owen . sure , he's hitting like crazy , but the guy cannot field to save his life ! and they said he was brought in to provide defense ? velarde , stankiewicz , and even silvestri are better defensively than owen . remember it's still early . look for his offense to tail off , and his defense to improve hopefully . he has that rep because i heard that either last year , or over the last 5 years , or something like that he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops behind c . r . and tony i m not gonna help this sorry mets team at all fernandez . i do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far .  2 tartabull . the book on tartabull was , keep him healthy and he will produce . well , he hasn not done too much so far . sure . he's hit a few homers , but those were all solo shots , and he hasn not gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed to give you . then again , he had a slow start last year once he got off the dl , that is and turned into a one man wrecking crew late in the year , so we will see .  3 the bullpen . ugh ! what happened ? we were supposed to have one of the most solid pens in the majors ! meanwhile , the pen has already blown three saves maybe more i haven not checked . the great howe farr lefty righty tandem ? farr's era is in the 20s or 30s , and howe's is . infinite . i didn not think such a thing was possible , but it is . hopefully , they will get their acts together , or else buck's gonna burn out the starters for fear that the bullpen will blow a lead .  in the immortal words of the scooter , holy cow , seaver ! that johnny key guy can pitch , can not he ?  see you in the series !  alan

3			flight	target	hundred	mac	belief	technology	ride	nasa	launch			 moonbase race , nasa resources , why ? ah , there's the rub . and a catch 22 to boot . for the purposes of a contest , you will probably not compete if n you can not afford the ride to get there . and although lower priced delivery systems might be doable , without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system . you are assuming that the low cost delivery system has to be a separate project . but why ? if you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion dollar prize , it is cheaper to develop your own launch system , charging its entire development cost against your contest entry , than to try to do it with existing launchers . no other demand is necessary . any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way .  this depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line . in other words , perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support , navigation , etc. could be developed prior to a low cost launch system . you wouldn not want to use the expensive stuff forever , but i would hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost mac , oops , i mean launch system comes on line . you are assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch system . but why ? the saturn v took less than six years , depending on exactly when you date its start . pegasus took about three from project start to first flight . before sdio chickened out on orbital development , the target date for an orbital dc y flight was 1996 . if you really want speed , consider that the first prototypes of the thor missile still in service as the core of the delta launcher shipped to the usaf less than 18 months after the development go ahead . one of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief that you can not build a launcher without taking ten years and spending billions of dollars . it isn not true and never was .
2			car	cross			 5w30 , 10w40 , or 20w50 well , there is a difference . i don not happen to have my sae manual handy , but oil viscosity in general decreases with temperature . the sae numbers are based on a typical curve that oils used to all have , running from say the viscosity of a room temperature 90 weight at 0c , down to say that of a room temperature 5 weight at 20c , for a typical 40 weight oil . oils that are designed for operation in normal temperatures just have a weight specification . oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a w tacked on the end , so in winter in a cold place , you would stick 10w in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer , to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year . modern multi viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature . as a result , their viscosity graphs cross over several curves . a multi vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures , a normal operating temperature and a cold one though i can not remember the numbers . in any event , the weights do indicate a significant difference . remember that your engine is temperature regulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fins most of the time unless you overheat it or something . any weight of oil is better than no oil , or than very old , carbonized oil . thin oil won not in general lubricate as well at temperature , thicker oil will like a 20w50 will lubricate better at temperature , but not as well during startup , when most engine wear occurs . if you are planning on making long drives , the 20w50 is probably fine esp . in the summer in your 10w40 car . but if you are making short drives , stick to the 10w40 .  don not drink soap ! dilute dilute ! ok !
3			faith	escrow	clipper	conversation	perspective	proposal	mr.	wire	crypto	right			 wiretapping reality today some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages somehow if non escrowed crypto goes away . a little perspective might be in order . the number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low . law enforcement has to present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of authorizations . thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor recorded by the government , and for that to happen they have to a have a pretty good reason , with evidence ; b use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons . though the system may be imperfect , it is a long way from the horror stories some here seem to believe or anticipate .  david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information , errors and omissions excepted . again we have the trust in government problem here . members of mr. sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which members of my generation find ridiculous . i would suggest that mr. sternlight read about the cointelpro program , or about j . edgar hoover , or about the wire tapping of martin luther king , then , after he has digested this information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations that they have no right to , even under their own laws . given the long history of members of the us government ignoring the laws that apply to them , it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid , and given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these individuals once they are discovered , it is no wonder that so many people in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for clipper . jamie jamison

5			church	christian	truth	education	interpretation	contradiction	arrogance	christianity	play	testament	bible	scripture			 the arrogance of christians .  are all truths also absolutes ? is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes ?  if the answer to either of these questions is no , then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths , and which truths are absolutes .  the answer to both questions is yes . perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then . to me , an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , situations , etc. true in every instance possible . do you agree with this definition ? i think you do similarly , all truth is absolute . indeed , a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms. when is something absolute ? when it is always true . obviously , if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms. a simple example in the new testament sorry i don not have a bible at work , and can not provide a reference , women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church . now , this is scripture . by your definition , this is truth and therefore absolute . do women in your church speak ? do they cover their heads ? if all scripture is absolute truth , it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals . yet , clearly , women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads . at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew up in . evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth . and there are plenty of other examples . can you reconcile this ? many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world . such a statement is terribly self contradictory . let me put it to you this way . if there are no absolutes , shouldn not we conclude that the statement , there are no absolutes is not absolutely true ? obviously , we have a contradiction here . i don not claim that there are no absolutes . i think there are very few , though , and determining absolutes is difficult . this is just one of the reasons why christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe . there is hardly consensus , even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation .  so ? people sometimes disagree about what is true . this does not negate the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe . but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute . how can you determine absolutes derived from scripture when you can not agree how to interpret the scripture ? it's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is absolute . do you deny that your own background , education , prejudices , etc. come into play when you read the bible , and determine how to interpret a passsage ? do you deny that you in fact interpret ? carol alvin
4			right			 nc vs hunt marine gay bashing in wilmington nc verdict so you feel that the defendents should have been convicted regardless of the evidence . now that would truely be a sad day for civil rights . i don not know about everybody else , but to me , they should have been convicted because of the evidence , which in my mind was quite sufficient . so , you sat in the court room and listened to the case . after careful consideration , you have come to your conclusion . well , good for you .
5			christian	temple	christ	jesus			 losing your temper is not a christian trait  i always suspected that i was human too it is the desire to be like christ that often causes christians to be very critical of themselves and other christians . i would like to remind people of the withering of the fig tree and jesus driving the money changers et . al . out of the temple . i think those were two instances of christ showing anger as part of his human side . jeff johnson

2			score	management	season	catcher	pitcher	league	baseball	talent	team	defense	gun	game			 zane ! rescue us from simmons ! oh please , it's way too early to get upset . so far simmons looks like a total idiot . whatever you say . i think it's just 12 games into the season myself , so i m going to wait a bit before calling names . 2 i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week . now otto's latest debacle has restored simmons reputation . now he looks like he is back in his 92 form when he had the al's highest era among starters . four our sake not ted's sake , i hope he pitches with a 3 . 5 era for the rest of the season . yeah , right . i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher , and i have no idea why simmons ever wanted him . on the other hand , i expect him to release otto if he doesn not turn things around pretty fast btw , otto's game score for that 0 ip stinker was only 22 , which points out a problem with the method since otto's performance was infinitely bad , and excruciatingly prolonged . 3 tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing . they are still doing decently . but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons , they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse . i think merced's rookie year was a bit flukey , but aren not you willing to give him some more at bats and tomlin a few more starts before acting so gloomy ? 4 walk well , he seems to be on the losing end tonight . but i still think that walk desrved his contract . no he didn not . walk is a time bomb . he has no stuff whatsoever , and when the league finally realizes this , it won not be pretty at all . 8 the rookie batters well , young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact . other than that , their excellent performance hasn not been too much of a surprise . i think we should thank doughty for that . don not be so fast doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele , which was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors . meanwhile , i m not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a six year free agent before the 1992 season . 9 rookie pitchers worse than expected , especially cooke . twice through the rotation , and you have given up ? yikes . 10 slaught how come he wasn not given a contract extension last year ? now his value has increased immensely . but so has his age , at least in baseball terms. the useful half life of a 34 year old injury prone catcher can not be much longer than a year . 11 lonnie smith ! well , eric davis was signed for a comparable amount . but he wanted to be a dodger , and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992 . i don not think there was any chance for the bucs to sign him . let's see . eric can hit better . he can run better . he can field better . now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis . an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith . he certainly wasn not last year . even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year , he won not be an asset . he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field . hey , that's the skates smith package deal . anybody who acquires lonnie for his defense or base running particularly at this stage is a real weirdo . 12 management big big zero . sauer has yet to make a forceful argument in favor of revenue sharing . he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay . if that's the goal of the team ownership , than i don not see why sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy . i don not know what he has or hasn not said about revenue sharing , so i can not comment there . 13 alex cole fiasco . stuff deleted ironically , the biggest accomplishment of simmons tenure was getting alex cole really cheap . too bad . that he gave him away in the expansion draft . it's annoying , but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain jeff king , it was probably unavoidable . meanwhile , i think bigger accomplishments of simmons tenure were getting some value for john smiley , not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year , drafting well in 1992 , letting the rookies show something in 1993 . foley , smith , and candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts , which means that even if fail it hasn not done serious damage to the bucs future . 14 compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it . the pirates can rant and rave . they will not get those picks . as of now , the issue is still being appealed . does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case ? i never heard the outcome of this . when will the final verdict be in on this ? now , if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots , nothing else will . i m not sure who was the idiot in this case , so i don not know who to blame . it might have been doug danforth , after all . in fact , i seriously suspect it was doug danforth , who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet . btw i have wondered whether my latest posts have been getting off site , so if somebody known to impersonate e . e . cummings can see this , would he drop me a short note ?
